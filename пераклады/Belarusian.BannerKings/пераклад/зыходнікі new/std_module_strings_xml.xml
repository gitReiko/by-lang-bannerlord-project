Asera is that which all followers of his Code seek to live up to; though most followers will accept that the words of Asera are transcribed to benefit the bloodlines which followed him.

    <string id="XyVMjNNp" text="Though there has long been an imperial cult in the Calradic Empire, it grew in popularity in the generations after Darusos’s murder. Emperors were deified, made to stand alongside their own gods as peers. During the waning generations of the united empire many would proclaim themselves god-emperor, or other divinely appointed titles; the rite of the divus can only transubstantiate an emperor upon their death. Thus the last truly ordained imperial cult is that which preaches the words of Arenicos Divus; though upstart branches have begun for an inevitable worship of Ira Divus." />

Iovis, the Sky-Father reigns as the henotheistic patriarch who traditionally dwells upon Mount Erithrys. He is accompanied by Astaronia, his bride who represents that which must be protected by the machinations of imperial might; and by his daughter Mesnona who was born from the ego of Iovis and who grants insight to mortal petitioners." />

The songs are often written in such a way that one may make known their beliefs and views on the subject by means of intonation; whilst the tomes depicting the tales are renown for their strange marginalia which often descend into comic flourishes where lesser scriveners depict their favored and reviled characters as strange creatures or grotesque beasts." />

Though traditionalists will note the Cant is but a deviation of the illuminated manuscripts and oral tales of the pre-Calradic Vlandian culture, modern adherents claim the Cant to be the methodology of rebels, wanderers, rascals, and conquerors. Subtlety is seldom found, and parables and morality plays are all too commonly twisted to back the ideology of the teller. As such the works depicted therein are often viewed as satire or crude witticisms, but few cloisters will deny their worth.

All tribesmen of the Aserai who do not wander as bedouin, are assumed to be followers of the Code of Asera - though only those who seek to study the intricacies of the mythic patrilineal bloodline and its influence upon the world are celebrated and viewed as Sons of Asera; a facet of colloquial nomenclature meant to force camaraderie as all members of the Sultanate make claim to being descendants of Asera. Faqir, akhund, imams, and mushid make up the various levels of clergy who preach the Code and seek to apply its nuanced legalisms and rites to the Southlands. As a whole, those who follow the Code of Asera place an emphasis on charity between communities, vengeance against those who defy precedent or tradition, and mercy given in kindness with justice forced if kindness is scorned." />
    <string id="uF2hBKKU" text="Do not be as a glutton or a beast; neither hoarding nor bloodlust should color your life.

But do not reveal yourself to be lax or limp of arm either; for justice will often be your task." />
    <string id="EFKv7DGi" text="You must never betray the blood of your blood, to do so is to spit upon the Code. If you are called to serve the Aserai, you must shed blood for their cause - at least once, so as to show that you honor your siblings even should you disagree with their choices. You must ensure any who serve you do not suffer the ravages of conflict without justice on your lips and a safe bastion for them to find reprieve in." />
    <string id="bnfbjMGa" text="…A curious question; though I suppose I would know the deeper answers to this. Few are the faqir or even imam who are as studied in the various things so easily lost in transcription or by cause of would-be sultans seeking to justify their cruelty. The Code does not abide warring between Sons, a facet easily lost and ignored but a point of shame that could tarnish many of our leaders." />
    <string id="hvuqVf2m" text="It is wise to ask this - we dwell in uncertain times. Greed and rage cloud the hearts of many. Do no harm to the other Sons of Asera; the villagers should never fear your blade in these lands. Do not rob them of their wealth, even if the Sultan demands it - you must be charitable, you are their sibling." />
    <string id="spy2ujFu" text="…And in weakness, do not allow others to usurp your station. Rebellion, sedition, betrayal - anathema to the Code of Asera. Brother shall not strike against brother, least of all by a knife in the back or by rousing a mob with vicious words or common strife. Suffer not rebellion, for to allow it to foment in the first place speaks to the immensity of your failings. All the pointless bloodshed which may come from such will tarnish you eternal, such that you may find yourself denied Heaven - condemned to an agony of your own making." />

No doctrine of peace can outweigh the Code of Asera in this regard. Many such debts need to be paid, and it is horrifying that our rulers so often choose to forget this. The serpent which bites you and slithers away does not leave you in peace; only when the serpent is crushed, maimed, unable to bite you again does it depart in peace." />
    <string id="8b9Qad8j" text="When you are called by your brothers, you must come to them; you must serve beside them, you must never fail them if it is in your power.

    <string id="NiDTPPz2" text="Know that I tolerate your presence on behalf of my blooded siblings in the Banu, and though you may desire to coax me with honeyed words or threats of coercion - know also that I am beyond your grasp. I am the Murshid of [Placename], and my word guides the Sultanate by the reading of the Code of Asera. Speak truthfully and with no deceit, lest I denounce your lineage and see them flayed to the last." />

    <string id="fvJt4aTX" text="Peace be to you, outlander. You do not carry yourself as a Son of Asera, so I shall forgive your ignorance - provided you come here in search of wisdom.

There may be precedent for one beyond our blood to successfully follow the code, but for this you should seek out an Akhund; a scholar of the faith." />

    <string id="cDU19QLK" text="I preach the Code of Asera, the backbone of our society, the soul of our nation. For we are all Sons of Asera in these lands, and it is through the patriarch’s example that we go forth in honor and bring glory to his legacy." />

    <string id="cWg41iew" text="You come before me, like a wriggling eel slithering to a master archer and asking to learn to wield the bow. I shall speak plainly to you, for my time is short and my station vaunted. When you see that which is evil, you must change it by whatever force you can - if not your hands, then your heart, if not your heart, then your words." />
    <string id="gToavgYL" text="A common question among the devout and misguided alike; for how can one truly be assured they walk the righteous path? We know not until the end comes and we are weighed against the deeds of our progenitor; but I shall guide you with what wisdom I can." />
    <string id="DXwkpjeQ" text="Consider your actions and why it is you perform them. If you are of influence, do you wield this power for the good of your siblings or do you take it for your own aggrandizement? When your people starve, do you feast? Do you turn to the sword? Is blood spilled for bread gained a worthy trade?" />
    <string id="u0iwuK22" text="It does my heart kindly to hear you wish to prove your faith. We live in an age of lip service by most - though I hold no blame to the common man for this; they show their adherence and their faith in their daily labors. If you wish to prove your faith and your adherence to doctrine, you must be a soul who knows peace and who adheres to hierarchy." />
    <string id="duyNvFEg" text="Seek to improve the lives of even the least of your people and you shall make kings of them all; and know that should you find yourself poorer and your servants richer that you are a better sibling than many of your blood.

    <string id="4zEWWVpe" text="Foremost in my viewing, as a man of the cities of our lands; is the act of almsgiving. We are as keepers to our brothers, to our sisters and siblings; and only a cruel soul would let the blood of their blood starve.You are only as pure as the lowest among us, and thus you purify yourself of sin when you seek to uplift the whole of the Aserai." />

Though outsiders are wont to confuse the Amra Ollamh as little more than tales of goblins, sprites, fair folk and woodland monsters - the creed itself is in fact a deeply involved cultural institution meant to instill the youth of Battania with the lessons of their forebears by way of colloquial metaphor. The Brithem, law-speakers and judges, more than often related to the headmen of their village, maintain traditions whilst the women of the Bandrui preach these tales to children with the hopes of driving them to boldness and hopeful ambitions later on in life. Cattle raiding, braggadocious dueling bouts, and no small amount of criminal activity paired with lessons of mercy make up much of what is learnt by those who follow the Amra Ollamh. Those seeking greater insight into the spiritual matters of the Battanians are more likely to be dissuaded by Brithem lawspeakers, so as not to intrude upon the more esoteric matters handled by the practitioners of the Derwyddon arts." />

It was during this period that doctrines and reforms attributed to the teenage Emperor Darusos, a figure infamously denied the rite of the divus by the generals who usurped him, were uncovered. Viewed as a divine Martyr, rebels and lesser cults throughout the Empire began to preach his teachings and claim that the divinity of the imperial line was inherent; that the rite of the divus was a formality at best or a means of vaunting false emperors to positions of divine power. Now worshiped throughout the Southern Empire and in hidden cells of far flung holdings, the Darusosian Martyrdom preach the divine mandate that enshrines the rulership of the line of Arenicos.

To come before me so discourteously, as if I were some mere member of the lay flamines meant to play scenes of betrayal like some fool goliard of the upstart borderland principalities? Glory be to Darusos, for he was not spared or given mercy from unclean company which sought beyond their station and it seems now that I am to be tested in the same unkind way." />
    <string id="eqT2hW8A" text="May you find the mercy not granted to the Martyr, {NAME}, for I have none to spare. You have the bearings and reputation of those who profit from the suffering of the Empire; a carrion beast treating our glorious nation as though it were a bloated carcass.

Or rather, they would drive you to shameful sorrow or to mock a Martyr - dead by savage hands.I would not do you such an unkindness.Pray, forgive me.

    <string id="CFrhW6EZ" text="Ave, citizen - and welcome. May I offer you wine and bread in commensality? I wish you hospitality and grace whilst under the auspices of the Empire.

If you are friend, I bid you allow me offer you succor and comfort; if you are yet to accept the Martyr into your heart, pray allow me to elucidate.You shall know no regret save for time spent in ignorance of a beatific truth." />
    <string id="QhEHgXaL" text="Mine is the voice that speaks for the Martyr’s will, alas only in mournful penitentials. I wear this mantle by my own volition, for overlong have there been aspiring tyrants who sought to further usurp his mandates by way of vile machinations. Seldom am I to preach, for mine is the role to contemplate the mysteries of creation as glanced by Darusos as he was made eternal through the rites of divus.Fret not, for though I hold all the myriad gods of our Empire - both those liberated from savage cultures and those brought with us from our ancestral birthplace - I am that which holds the Martyr above all others." />
    <string id="oZddNoSP" text="I preach the doctrines of Darusos, our Emperor betrayed in his youth by the vile treachery of his generals. A child, wise beyond his years and graced with the beatific sight of Heaven; he sought to see the Empire reign as a place of order where patrician and plebeian alike need not suffer fear. He would see us fed, watered, and granted the joys that we are due - and if not for the craven workings of sellswords and tyrant upstarts, he would have reigned one thousand years." />
    <string id="fPT4Barn" text="Lo, for I preach the tragedy of the Martyr Darusos, an Emperor betrayed in his youth by the cruel ambitions of his generals. He was targeted, for even the most oathbound man can be made a craven sellsword when they gaze upon the throne of an Empire. Darusos was a goodly sort, he wept for the Palaics and the Vakken, he wrote an elegy for the Perassic League in their fading days. He saw the Empire as united in soul and in spirit, undone from within only by the actions of wicked men. It was for this that Darusos was crucified upon a sacred fig tree and set ablaze - all his aspirations but kindling… Take heart, for this is the sermon of a Martyr - not merely one of a man." />
    <string id="dh0cpao4" text="‘Tis my desire to spread the denied transpositions of the Martyr to the licentious masses of our age. To absolve our Empire the foul stains of hubristic usurpers, and to see seized with thine own hands a fate where the line betwixt Darusos to Arenicos, and beyond to Rhagaea Pethros and Ira Pethros may undergo the rite of divus before tragedy may befall them. I preach that the god - emperors of old who claimed deified rank, clutched at such power only through the long gaze of history.By candlelight mine eyes have gleaned that such heights are not unattainable, that within the mysteries and doctrine of Darusos, sits the illustrious path to Heaven that man may tread without departing the mortal coil." />
    <string id="EkCUxcN4" text="But no. Betrayed by his generals, spat upon by the Senate, and mocked by his honor guard - Darusos was crucified to a sacred fig tree and burnt to cinders. His great works and scribed doctrines set ablaze with him. As one of the Flamines Castus, I seek to purify those who have walked a path of sin and shame.For the Martyr knows that the failings of those who betrayed them were born from human frailty -they feared change, and in their fear enacted change as fearsome as any other.None of us are immaculate, but there are some who may become pure and unsullied such as I.Pray then, that you may become like me." />
    <string id="b9bfZtiZ" text="The imperial line was enshrined upon the throne by a hand most divine during its origins, and thus though Darusos was murdered by militants - his words could not be silenced. Though upstarts like Lucon Osticos and Garios Comnos would seek to usurp the mandate of heaven, consider that the late Emperor Arenicos Pethros was a man-made-divine who was Martyred in a similar fashion. It is only through Empress Rhagaea Pethros and the heir Ira Pethros - that this holy line continues. History should not repeat itself further.No more heroes of our Empire need die for the vanity of lesser men or savage nationals.Darusos awaits us in heaven, and paradise is awarded to those who seek to better the lives of his citizens, and enact the reforms he was denied in life." />
    <string id="xcCHnLYz" text="Ahh, ‘tis wisdom and arrogance that thou shalt seek the Rex Sacrarum for elucidation. What is thine intent, to seek one wise beyond the ken of an age and bid they preach the rote doctrine of the lay flamines? Thoust have no need to be coy, nor ignorant, nor false. I shall speak and do so with courtesy - for this is what the Martyr would have of me. Perilous is the hour and heretics run rife through our Empire.Scourge those who cling to the Augeo Sophica or the Parens Patriae, shame their leaders; see them seized by brutish hands befitting brutish miens such as theirs.Let not their disarray see our fiefs fall to the avaricious hearts of lesser, wayward men." />

Make yourself known and friend to others within the ranks of the Flamines Castus, gain an audience and supplicate yourself before the Rex Sacrarum. " />

    <string id="BZcB9LOv" text="I would suffice to bid you take arms against the Embers of the Flame, they preach a false doctrine and grant hospitality to those who would see us destroyed. Their workings dishonor the Martyr - and should you shackle their heresiarch, I would see them brought before me.

    <string id="L87e0h2a" text="Food production relies on acreage. Each acre of land requires an amount of workforce. If it is met, the acre will produce food.

Soon, Llewellyn the Green has found many smithies in his domain, that supplied Battanian archers with two hand swords, creating army of Fian Champions and became first king of the highlands. Fian Champions were a nightmare for Imperial army for centuries, not only because of very well known archery skills, but also because of exceptional swordmanship. Ever since, Llewellyn was since knwon as R�ghf�nnid, king of the Fians." />
    <string id="R5GJQu3Q" text="Written by Leonhardth of Ocspool, this monumental work is considered a founding text of Vlandia, as it popularized usage of crossbows and siege engines among Vlandian lords during the rule of King Osrac Iron-arm. Thanks to clear descirption of crossbow and balista constuction and simple explanations of physics behind the contraption even lords of a single village were able to supply their peasants with deadly weapons. It is said that Vlandia is build on crossbow and lance and this work is a proof, that Leonhardth of Ocspool deserves at least half of credit for Vlandian indpendence." />
    <string id="iaGGjVGP" text="This legend dates to the times of migration of nords from Nordland and Jumne to contemporary sturgian lands and tells story of princess Francesca. Though beautiful, she was so strong, that she was able to cut through enemy shields by throwing an axe at them. The legend tells a story pursuing her dreams despite odds. She wished to sail south, to plentiful sturgian Vanni woods, but her strict Jarl father denied her permission to do so. To prove she is able to make her own decisions she ventured north and managed to kill ice dragon of Jumne with a throw of a single axe, that cut off all three heads of the mighty beast. When she brought the trophy back, her father gave her blessing to cross the Byalic sea. Soon she and her crew set out for the journey and after many adventures they settled near Alebat tribe. She fell in love with young cheftain of that tribe and married him soon after." />
    <string id="7TMGrRS4" text="Aseran Papyrus is probably oldest known medical written text in Calradia. The book is written as dialogue between legendary Aserai patriarch (Asera) and his physician in which the ruler asks questions and the physician provides the answers. This type of discourse makes possible both a discussion of general ethics and philosophies of life and the inclusion of the prevailing Aserai religious beliefs. In general, the book integrates moral and physical conduct and provides an important relationship between mental and physical states of health. The common theme seems to be moderation in everything, harmony with nature, contentment with oneself, and restraining and reducing one's desires- sensible ways of handling physical and mental stresses and their devastating effects on health and longevity." />

The shadows of dawn are long and cold. ut there was one farmer, some say he was a Massa, others that he was the son of a Nord. Most of us count him as a snake god, but that is another tale. His name was Orm. The Battanians told Orm about a towering giant of stone, the one that was sleeping in the way of his sunlight. His name was Mordus. They said that if he got the giant drunk on wine, he’d be easier to knock down. Mordus was one of the Calradians’ Titans of Stone. He was the bastard of a Battanian god.

So Mordus watched Orm yoke a fine ox and plough slowly south towards him. And he drank. The sun was setting over the western sea. He drank so much that he didn’t see the ox was ploughing away the mountainside, by the time the ox came close, Mordus was asleep. And so Oca picked up the pace as night fell and charged right at the sleeping Mordus and cut him to pieces. In the morning light, Orm was horrified. There stood Oca, a giant ox, drinking wine from Mordus’ corpse. It had spilled into the furrow made the day before. Orm shouted at Oca: “I asked you to plough away the body of Mordus but here you are drinking up my wine.”, to which the go replied: “No. This is the wine thou hast promised me. But thou gavest it to Mordus. Now I plough no more. Every summer I will come back and drink this wine, and thou shalt have nothing more from the gods. Instead, beest happy with what thou havest.
