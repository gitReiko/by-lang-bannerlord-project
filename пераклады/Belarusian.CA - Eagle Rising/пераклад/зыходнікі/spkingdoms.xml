  <string id="aEfsyVH4" text="Many of the oldest families of the Empire live in the north. They came here as marcher lords, granted vast tracts of land by their colleagues in the Senate to keep 'pacified' northern tribes in check and hold the frontiers against Battanian, Sturgian, and Khuzait raiders. They drained marshes and turned the river floodplains into wheatfields, cut back forests and turned the hillsides into pasture. But as the republic became an empire and as emperors became more and more dependent on money and lands to reward their loyal soldiers, the nobility here began to fear that their estates would one day be seized by some cash-starved tyrant. Consequently, in the ongoing imperial civil war they have become some of the strongest champions of Lucon, who sees a Senate of established property-holders as the supreme authority and the emperor as its servant."/>

  <string id="mOZsbV8j" text="According to tradition, the first Calradians entered the continent as exiles, coming from lands across the western ocean. But the Empire's center of gravity moved east and south, and their original heartland has, for the most part, been lost to the Vlandians. The west of the Empire today, a warm green land of oak forests and volcanic outcrops, was mostly conquered from the Palaic tribes. They have intermarried with Calradian colonists and today their old languages and customs are mostly forgotten. Service in the legions has traditionally been a path out of rural poverty and many an ambitious general has drawn his most loyal recruits from this region. The landowners here have naturally gravitated towards Garios, the partisan of soldiers and soldiers' interests, in the ongoing civil war."/>

  <string id="GbnlN6na" text="southern Imperium"/>
  <string id="Xtyb9Dyr" text="The lands that are now the southern Empire were once ruled by proud independent city-states controlling trading routes over the Perassic Sea and the steppe. They invited the Empire into their internal feuds and one by one they were absorbed, some by treaty, some by conquest. Calradian aristocrats intermarried with merchant princes and nomad chiefs, many of whom claimed descent from the kings, champions and demigods of eastern legends. In recent generations, as these towns grew to become some of the richest and most populous in the continent, many Senatorial families elsewhere became suspicious that the southerners would someday try to make one of their own into a hereditary monarch. The southern nobility's support for Rhagaea, an unapolegetic advocate of the dynastic principle, would seem to confirm these fears."/>

A few among them have been made leaders for their fair dealings and respect in warfare. They live hard lives, and pride themselves on adventure and skill in combat. Their savage fights, foreign customs, and the look in their eyes terrify anyone unfortunate enough to endure their raids and migrations."/>

  <string id="cla_kingdom_carthage_text" text="Hail Caesar, Augustus, Divine Imperator, and Princeps Civitatis of the Imperium. It has been two months since our arrival in the merchant republic of Qutsith. The intelligence reports do not pay justice to illustrious markets of the Kanic lords. They are brimming with life - exotic furs, animals, trinkets from distant lands, and all manner of goods can be found. The people are predominantly of Kanic and Nahasi origin - but travelers of many cultures can be found here. Our Frumentarii cohort found no difficulties posing as traders - a few well placed bribes and forged documentation from the scriptorium allowed us entry. Per your orders, we have been investigating the unexplained disappearances of our imperial caravans, and the many rumors of unrest. While we began our initial investigation with the hypothesis of Darshian involvement - it is with utmost haste I write with dire warning. While upon the surface - to the untrained eye, the merchant city appears to be content with the prosperous trade agreements and divine protection of the imperium, but our observations indicate something is changing. In the alleys - we notice heavily armed mercenaries of foreign origin. In the taverns - there is clear anti-imperium rhetoric being whispered among the people. Our agents uncovered a large increase in weapon shipments - which led to an investigation of the surrounding lands. Although a clear attempt at obfuscation was made, we found large encampments of Kanic warriors and unknown barbarians. These alone are of no concern to our mighty legions - but the monsters they rode upon have filled this humble servant with dread. They rode upon hulking beasts with husks the size of a man. There can be no doubt - the Kannic merchants prepare for war. Before it is too late - I beseech my imperator to forcefully occu - *The rest of the parchment is covered in blood and thus illegible, but it seems our spies were correct in their suspicions of Calradian infiltration* - unsent intelligence report of an unknown agent of the Frumentarii"/>

Amply named after the mountainous territory of which they occupy, they are a hard and unbending people. Despite our generous attempts at diplomacy and trade, the barbarians are resistant to the glorious embrace of our Imperator. They hold no decorum - peaceful diplomats are returned disembodied, no doubt having met their demise at the wicked end of their curved swords. With reports of a “king” unifying their tribes, it is clear these barbarians cannot be pacified. By order of our illustrious Imperator, I travel now with the might of a full legion. I will lay claim to their rich mines, and will remove the silver helm from this so-called king with my own hands. - Last excerpt of Claudius Allobrogicus, disgraced Legatus of the Imperium, before the disaster at Diathma - 127 AC"/>

Ask any Battanian chieftain, however, whose ”kingdom” he lives in, and he will look around at his hall and his fields and his pastures, his flocks and his retainers, and answer ”Mine, of course.” Only lately, following the example of the Empire, have the High Kings made any effort to exert their authority. ”Such unruly cattle as my people require a strong herdsman's hand to steer them from the ravine and protect them from the wolf,” said one recent high king, just before he was betrayed by a jealous cousin and taken in chains to the nearest imperial outpost."/>

  <string id="fGNdo1BK" text="For centuries, the tribes in the vast steppe east of the Empire were content to live as nomads, venturing into the imperial lands to raid and trade, and then returning to their ancestral freedom. Two generations ago, however, something happened far away to the east - a change in the winds, perhaps, or some terrible but distant conqueror - and the horse clans were set in motion. Urkhun the Khuzait led the nomads nearest the Empire into its far eastern provinces, conquering the towns and forming a khanate. He imposed discipline on the unruly clans, forcing them to ride to war on his command instead of simply when they wished. But after his death, the spirit of unity that he inspired was lost. His descendants still rule the khanate. But some of the other Khuzait leaders chafe under the authority of the current khan, Monchug, and others dream of becoming khan themselves."/>
