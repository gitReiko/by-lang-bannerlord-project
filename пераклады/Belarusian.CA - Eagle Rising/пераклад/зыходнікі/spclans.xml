  <string id="ghilmanClanName" text="Ghilman"/>
  <string id="4TiYXBqK" text="The Ghilman are a band of mercenaries who recruit from the tribes of southern Calradia and the lands to the east. They are legally their own slaves and masters: each “sells“ himself to the order and, in the process, becomes a part-owner. They are known for their fine horses and fine clothes. But no one should assume from their oiled locks, perfumes and peacock feathers that they spend more time preening then training. Their skills as mounted archers are second to none, and as lancers are close behind the Vlandians and the imperial cataphracts."/>
  <string id="LqTTchsa" text="Legion of the Betrayed"/>
  <string id="Ssl38GEF" text="Legion"/>
  <string id="bhxVA9w7" text="The Last Legion was created after the Emperor Arenicos abolished the last of the Empire's standing armies in the wake of the battle of Pendraic, relying instead on the archons' private retinues which were significantly cheaper and better at controlling territory. The Legion is made up of men who detested this change: they loved the old army, its standards and its unit histories and its camp life, and they blame the new system for destroying the empire. But an army does not hold together unless it is paid regularly, and they take contracts from imperial and foreign lords alike."/>
  <string id="7k9izAvC" text="Skolderbroda"/>
  <string id="bsPd5zri" text="The Skolderbroda, or Shield Brothers, are a mercenary company for warriors who take fighting and training very seriously. They are primarily Nordic but do allow recruits from other cultures, as long as an already-serving Shield Brother will vouch for them. Their rules are almost monastic:no women in their encampments and no amusements, and no Brother is allowed to spend the night outside without permission. In combat they fight with spear and axe in the Nordic style, and are valued by all the noble houses of the north."/>
  <string id="UmVjzPI4" text="Company of the Golden Boar"/>
  <string id="GCy0xb6U" text="Company"/>
  <string id="tae3lhXh" text="The Company are Vlandians, mostly local levies who don't adjust well to peacetime and who have opted for a life of constant warfare. They are probably the least disciplined and most brigandish of Calradia's mercenaries, and a scourge to any bit of countryside where they are allowed to run loose. Still, like all mercenaries, they know that their future earnings depend on their reputation, so they honor their contracts and practice their skills, particularly with the crossbow, to ensure their employers receive their money's worth."/>
  <string id="NObV048p" text="Beni Zilal"/>
  <string id="dRaYhQva" text="The origins of the Beni Zilal, the Sons of the Shadows, are shrouded in legend. Many of the stories tell of a messianic preacher who ruled from a citadel deep in the desert, entrancing his followers with the help of halucinogenic herbs and terrorizing the Aserai nobility with the threat of assassination. Regardless of how much truth these stories contain, this brotherhood is now a powerful institution in the deep reaches of the Nahasa, collecting protection money from caravans passing through its territory and cutting deals with local potentates while it awaits the day when it may reveal its hand more openly."/>
  <string id="nh4Y3LOc" text="Wolfskins"/>
  <string id="7bhNgOKd" text="The Wolfskins are heirs to a long tradition in the Battanian lands in which warriors-in-training go “wilding” for part of their youth, learning the ways of the woods and how to suffer hardship. So long as a Wolfskin wears no sewn clothes, eats no cooked food, and sleeps under no roof, he is immune from the laws of men. In fact, the modern Wolfskins tend to be the sons of wealthy families taking a few years to indulge their feral side, robbing travellers and living viciously and not necessarily hewing to the old code."/>
  <string id="as2TiAIJ" text="Brotherhood of the Woods"/>
  <string id="khnadIv1" text="Brotherhood"/>
  <string id="xahrUc5n" text="The Brotherhood of the Woods started as a Vlandian peasant movement, hiding out in the forests, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor. However, it encountered the problems that any long-running rebel movement might - it needed to ensure a steady supply of food, and also ensure that none of the poor would dare earn a bag of coins by informing on them. Slowly but surely, it began to make use of extortion, terror, and corrupt deals with the local authorities to survive, becoming little different from any other organized bandit group in Calradia."/>
  <string id="MVHawAEp" text="Hidden Hand"/>
  <string id="j3KtHQzn" text="Hand"/>
  <string id="nQOf27Rx" text="The Hidden Hand are a mafia who dominate the rural areas, and sometimes the towns, of the southern parts of the Empire. They thrive by making themselves useful to authorities: repressing unrest, silencing troublesome preachers, and robbing from merchants who compete with their patrons. Many of them go back and forth between a respectable life in the towns and a criminal life in countryside. A member of the Hand might spend two or three months a year in the hills as a brigand, then return to town to work as an enforcer and a ”trader” in stolen goods, knowing full well that no one will ask him too many questions."/>
  <string id="7WL1LWdf" text="Lake Rats"/>
  <string id="9ZEdEWmi" text="The Lake Rats live in the marshes on the shores of the great northern lake, in shacks made out of the timbers of ruined ships. They live by “wrecking“ - ie, luring ships onto shoals with false lighthouses and beacons. Because they're scorned by the rest of Calradia - ”all criminals, smell like marsh gas and mud and rotten fish” - they scorn everyone else back. Although mostly Sturgian, their ranks have been swelled by fugitives, debtors, and anyone else who'd rather live by a thieves' code than by the laws of nobles."/>
  <string id="mtZu1l2j" text="Embers of the Flame"/>
  <string id="zcLTthfN" text="Embers"/>
  <string id="B8c2mNKj" text="The Embers of the Flame are the descendants of a rebel movement that rose up nearly a century ago, after the saintly but ineffective teenaged Emperor Darusos was toppled by one of his generals. They claim that they are preparing the way for Heaven to bring back Darusos and usher in a golden age, but like so many other rebel movements in Calradia they have been forced to turn to extortion to survive."/>
  <string id="8ba4tpRU" text="Gawwal"/>
  <string id="RWOYui01" text="The Gawwal, or “Roamers,” are the main bedouin confederacy in the Nahasa desert. They wander from highland to lowland grazing grounds, declaring huge swathes of the desert their “territory” in which any caravan must offer protection money. They compose poems of their deeds and mock other clans of the Banu Asera for having given up the “freedom” of black wool tents for stone houses in the oases. The other clans consider them boastful nuisances, though grudgingly respecting them as protectors of the old Nahasi ways."/>
  <string id="6BvGhzao" text="Karakhergit"/>
  <string id="XJbDRBfd" text="The Karakhergit are one of the last nomadic clans in the western steppe. The Urkhunid khans have tried to coax them into settling down, offering them farmlands and serfs in exchange for a commitment to pay taxes and supply military levies, but they have resisted. They are treated by the other clans with a combination of envy and contempt. They trade and sometimes even intermarry with their settled brethren, but they also do a limited amount of kidnapping for ransom and raiding of flocks, and scoff at those who would blame them for carrying on with the heroic old ways."/>
  <string id="o7ud4X2X" text="Forest People"/>
  <string id="0u8ipbgn" text="The tribes known as the Forest People practice slash-and-burn farming in the deep woods, outside the grasp of the Sturgian boyars. They burn down tracts of trees, grow crops on the virgin soil fertilized by ash for a few years until the land is exhausted, and move on. It is an inefficient use of land but a very efficient use of labor, suitable for a numerically small population in a large area. Also, because the plots are hard to measure and tax, it's a very good strategy for people who don't care to be governed."/>
  <string id="eC6qIOzz" text="Eleftheroi"/>
  <string id="9qAWNBvA" text="The Eleftheroi, the free people, live on the steppelands at the edge of the Empire. Originally the descendants of runaway slaves and debtors, they soon became highly valued by the local imperial commanders for their knowledge of this frontier zone. Their leaders have been granted titles, their young men taken into the retinues of archons and emperors. But though they are now very loyal to the idea of the Empire, they remain quite hostile to its actual authority."/>
