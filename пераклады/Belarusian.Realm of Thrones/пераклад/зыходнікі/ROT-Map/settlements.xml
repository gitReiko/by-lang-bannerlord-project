  <string id="8UJ3cPrZ" text="Myzea gives its name to the Myzeiad, the rich hill country of the east-central empire. This region is the old stomping grounds of the senator Litos, who brought the Palaic tribes here into the empire relatively peacefully by offering them protection against raiders from the steppes. When he fell afoul of his rivals in the Senate, however, he tried to organize them into a rival 'barbarian' republic modelled on the ancient Calradian version. The empire snuffed it out, but the people here, now thoroughly Calradicized, still harbor an attachment to the old republican system and its partisans."/>

  <string id="ROT01173" text="Dragonstone"/>
  <string id="ZAGUIKOn" text="Lageta was infamously acquired by the Empire by an act of treachery. A rogue imperial mercenary murdered the Palaic chieftain who employed him, took the citadel, invited in imperial colonists, then bequeathed the town to the Empire.

It was named for the Lady Zeona, one of the few women to rule the Empire - admittedly as regent for her son rather than Empress Regnant. It is known for the Zeonic Wind, a gale that blows northward across the Perassic Sea every summer carrying the burning heat of the Nahasa desert to the imperial south.

  <string id="TI3fS2xN" text="Every realm has a city whose inhabitants are mocked for their provincial unsophistication, and for the Empire that city was Jalmarys. One of the first imperial colonies established inland of the Perassic Sea, it served the Empire as a base to subdue the western Palaic tribes. Paravenos was happy to accept the plunder and slaves sent to them from its garrison, but snickered at them behind their backs. That changed when the Jalmaryan general Carsos staged a military coup. When a senator, stymied by his thick accent, nervously asked him to repeat a decree, he unsheathed his sword and said, 'Do you understand this?'"/>

In its early centuries, it fell under the authority of the Kannic city-state of Quyaz, but the empire's expansion soon united the colony with its mother republic. For centuries, sailors coming from the pirate-infested islands of the Bay of Charas gave thanks when they saw its towers looming through the haze of the western Perassic, signalling a return to safe imperial-patrolled waters."/>

Inevitably, he fell into conflict with the Empire, and during the siege an earthquake crumbled his walls and allowed imperial troops into the city. More died in the ensuing sack than the tyrant had ever killed, but it was war, and the outcome - attributed to the wrath of Heaven - was a staple of imperial propaganda as they expanded their foothold in the region."/>
