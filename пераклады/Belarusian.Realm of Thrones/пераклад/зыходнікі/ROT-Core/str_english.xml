House Martell was founded by Morgan Martell, an Andal adventurer who settled between the mouth of the Greenblood and the Broken Arm during the coming of the Andals to Dorne. Morgan led the defeat of the local First Men, including Houses Wade and Shell, establishing his rule over a strip of land fifty leagues long and ten leagues wide. They did not rule as kings, but were cautious vassals of kings from Houses Jordayne, Allyrion, and Yronwood, as well as petty kings of the Greenblood. At the time of the Rhoynish Wars, the Martells were one of the lesser ruling families of Dorne. At the time of the arrival of the Rhoynish warrior queen Nymeria, around 700 BC, the lands of the Martells were dwarfed by those of House Yronwood. Mors Martell, the Lord of the Sandship, saw an opportunity in the arrival of the Rhoynar, and took Nymeria to wife. Combining their strength, the two managed to unite all of Dorne under their rule in Nymeria's War."/>

House Dustin fought for the House Targaryen during the War of the Ninepenny Kings. Brandon Stark, heir to Lord Rickard Stark, was fostered at Barrowton by old Lord Dustin, though he spent most of his time in the Rills. Though Lord Rodrik Ryswell sought to wed his daughter Barbrey to Brandon, she would end up marrying Lord Willam Dustin, the son of the old Lord of Barrowton. Six months after their wedding, Lord Willam followed his liege Lord Eddard Stark in Robert's Rebellion against King Aerys II Targaryen. Lord Dustin was one of the six companions that fought alongside Lord Eddard at the tower of joy against the remaining members of the Mad King's Kingsguard, where he was slain. His bones were buried beneath the red mountains of Dorne. While Lord Eddard returned Willam's stead, he did not return his bones. Taking it as a slight, Lady Dustin held a grudge on the Starks and grew bitter with her overlords."/>

At some point, House Martell bent the knee to the Jordayne kings of the Tor. By the time of Nymeria's War, House Jordayne was among the bannermen of King Yorick Yronwood, and they fought against Lord Mors Martell and his Rhoynar allies. During the first couple of years of the First Dornish War, King Aegon I Targaryen captured several Dornish castles, including the Tor, whose steward surrendered the castle peacefully to Aegon a short time after the death of Lord Jordayne. The Dornishmen quickly recaptured the castle in Aegon's absence.

After Aegon slew the man, he learned that the man was Lord Toland's mad fool, and that Lord Toland himself had escaped. In later days, the Tolands would take a new banner, showing a dragon biting its own tail, with the colors green in gold in memory of the motley of their brave fool. Prior to the dragon, the Toland banners displayed a ghost. The Dornishmen quickly recaptured Ghost Hill after Aegon left the castle. In 8 AC, Queen Visenya Targaryen mounted on Vhagar, burned Sunspear, Lemonwood, Ghost Hill and the Tor in retaliation for the dornishmen's actions against the stormlands earlier that year.

	<string id="ROT00261" text="The Calradians are the people of the Empire, though by now they have given their name to the entire continent which they dominate. A thousand years ago, they were an undistinguished tribe living in the hill country between the southern sea and the Battanian woods. One tradition set them apart from their neighbors - the Calradoi had no kings. Their citizenry has always taken an intense interest in the art of self-government, the balance between protecting the liberty of individuals and the needs of the state. Perhaps this is why they had a slight edge in the endless wars between one town and another, keeping armies in the field just a little longer, bouncing back just a little more quickly from a defeat. Some of their neighbors federated with them; others were overrun. Eventually the Calradians formed an empire, which evolved into a monarchy in all but name. Their leaders are no longer distinguished civic elders but great landholders scattered across the continent; the striking force of their armies is no longer citizen-infantry but heavily armored cataphracts in the retinues of the wealthy. But they still take their civic traditions very seriously, believing that the Calradian ideal can unite a continent in peace, if only the ”barbarians” beyond their borders would agree to submit to it."/>
	<string id="ROT00262" text="Dorne"/>
	<string id="ROT00263" text="The Aserai are the principal inhabitants of the Nahasa, the Bronze Desert, in the south of Calradia. To the outsider it would appear a desolate place, fields of dunes broken by gravel plains and volcanic outcrops. But there is water underground, trapped in depressions or beneath the wadis where the occasional flash flood rumbles by, and in these oases people have settled. They are divided into dozens of clans and sub-clans, each with its elaborate genealogy, but are collectively known as the Banu Asera, the sons of Asera. Their sense of nationhood, such as it is, comes from tracing their lineage to this legendary patriarch. Their wealth and power, which is considerable, comes from controlling the isolated water-sources that allow caravans from distant lands to cross the desert."/>

	<string id="ROT00266" text="The first Vlandians arrived from overseas, mercenaries and adventurers, speaking the tongues of many lands, taking the empire's silver to guard the frontiers against the unsubdued tribes of the interior. They took their name from one of their first warlords, Wilund the Bold - Valandion, in Calradic - and became known as the Vlandians. Their heavy cavalry, second to none, ran down the Emperor's foes from the Aserai wastes to the distant steppes. But cash-strapped officials soon began to pay them with land grants and titles instead of silver, perhaps not the most far-sighted of policies. The Vlandians settled, married, planted farms, and seized nearby imperial fortresses as their own. Now they are an independent kingdom, their traditions drawing from both Calradia and their distant homelands."/>
	<string id="ROT00267" text="North"/>
	<string id="ROT00268" text="The misty hills of north-western Calradia are dominated by the Battanian clans, the original inhabitants of much of the continent. Their hilltop fortresses have born witness to countless wars fought to resist outside invaders: first the Empire's legions, and more recently the rising Sturgian and Vlandian kingdoms. They are masters of the longbow, the night raid, the sudden wild charge out of the woods. They idolise valour, but especially like it when mixed with a bit of mischief - the cattle thief who can whisk an entire herd into the fog; the champion who dines with a rival tribe, and, regaling his hosts with an anecdote of battle, produces from his bag the skull of one of their kinsmen that he took as a souvenir."/>

	<string id="ROT00270" text="The tribes that live in the great sea of grass east of the Empire have many names: Nachaghan, Arkits, Khergits, Karakhergits. Outsiders, however, usually refer to them collectively as the Khuzaits, after the clan that in the last two generations forged them into a conquering army. When Urkhun the Great accepted the surrender of the trading cities on the edge of the steppe, he ordered his noyans to give up their wandering lifestyle. They were given fiefs and money to build fortresses, and encouraged to turn local farmers into their tenants. Yet the tribes of the Khuzait confederacy still retain many of their nomadic traditions, and felt yurt tents stand next to mud-brick towers in settlements that are half-village, half-encampment."/>

Elegant windows are scattered thinly across the walls in a seemingly random pattern, along with asymmetric crenelations for archers and artillery. A regular gate with great metal doors, a draw bridge and hot oil pots offers a warm haven within these cold, isolated lands and it's the only way in, at least without taking down the castle walls. Plain fields of a type of grass cover most of the fields outside of the castle, adding to the castle's aesthetics. This castle has clearly stood the test of time, the rocks of the walls are aged and vines and plants grow inside the cracks, but this castle will last for ages to come." />

		<string id="tywin3" text="}So, the die is cast. War it is. Know this, A Lannister does not fight battles he cannot win. You will see my banners on the field, my arrows will rain, and when the dust settles, the Lion will roar over its enemies once more." />
		<string id="stannis3" text="}So it has come to this. Hard truths cut both ways, and the truth is this: I will see my enemies burn, or I will die with my sword in hand. The Iron Throne is mine, and no pretender will take it from me." />
		<string id="jorah3" text="}If it’s war you want, it’s war you’ll get. The dragons will fly, and the world will burn before the Targaryens fall." />
		<string id="edmure3" text="}So, you’ve chosen to bring war to the Riverlands. House Tully will not fall easily. The rivers will run red with the blood of invaders." />
		<string id="renly3" text="}So, it’s war, then? Very well. My knights are the finest in Westeros, and my bannermen loyal to the end. You’ll find that I’m not as soft as some would think. You’ve chosen your side, and now you’ll face the consequences." />
		<string id="alliser3" text="}You dare to challenge the Night’s Watch? Very well, but know this, the Wall has stood for thousands of years, and you’ll find it’s no easy foe to topple." />
		<string id="gregor3" text="}War is what I do best. Your men will fall before me like wheat before the scythe. No mercy, no retreat." />
		<string id="sansa3" text="}If you bring war to the Starks, you will find the North united against you. Winterfell has endured for generations, and we will endure you as well." />
		<string id="yara3" text="}So, war it is. My reavers will strike fast and hard, leaving nothing behind but salt and fire. Prepare yourself…you’ll find no safe harbor here." />
		<string id="margaery3" text="}So, war it is. The Reach has endured countless trials, and we will endure this one. May the Seven guide your choices, for you’ll need their mercy." />
		<string id="mace3" text="}The Reach is no stranger to war. The rose may be gentle, but its thorns can sting. The Tyrells are strong and we will defend our interests at all costs. Soon, you will see the full strength of Highgarden on the field." />
		<string id="barristan3" text="}Then you leave us no choice. I have served kings and queens my entire life, and I will not falter now. You will taste defeat at the hands of the Dragon Queen." />
		<string id="ROTtZbRW25E" text="}You may have captured me in battle, but the North will never yield to tyrrany." />
		<string id="tormund4" text="}Don’t make me laugh. A she-bear tried to eat me once, and I turned her into a lover. When I get out of this, I’ll show you what happens when you try to cage the Wildlings." />
		<string id="ROTcersei4" text="}I am Cersei Lannister and I will not go quietly!" />
		<string id="joffrey4" text="}This is treason! You’ll hang for this, all of you! My men will come, and when they do, I’ll have your heads on spikes. I am your king. Where is my grandfather?!" />
		<string id="jon4" text="}Do what you will with me, but I’ve sworn an oath. The Wall and the Night’s Watch will endure long after you’ve faded into memory." />
		<string id="dany4" text="}Dracarys! You think a Targaryen can be caged? You may hold me, but my dragons are free, and they will come for me. Fire and blood will rain down upon you, and you will know the wrath of House Targaryen." />
		<string id="tywin4" text="}Captured? You misunderstand. This is a delay, not a defeat. Do you imagine for a moment that this changes anything? My bannermen will rally to free me, as they always do. Kings and rebels have tried to break me before, only to learn one simple truth: lions do not yield." />
		<string id="stannis4" text="}Captured? So be it. My duty remains, and I will see it done. Even in chains, I am Stannis Baratheon. Go on, do your duty, but do not think this ends here." />
		<string id="jorah4" text="}Do what you will, I’ve endured worse. But know thi… my loyalty remains unbroken, and the Queen will not forget my capture." />
		<string id="edmure4" text="}You’ve taken me prisoner, but don’t think this will break House Tully. Riverrun stands strong, and my people will not abandon me." />
		<string id="renly4" text="}Well, this is inconvenient. But don’t mistake it for a victory. My cause is just, and my supporters will not rest until I’m free. You may have me in chains, but you’ll never break my claim, or my spirit." />
		<string id="alliser4" text="}Captured? Hah. You’ll find me as unyielding as the Wall itself. Do what you will, but you won’t break me…or the Night’s Watch." />
		<string id="gregor4" text="}Captured, am I? You’re a fool if you think you’ve won. I’ll break every chain, every man who holds me, and when I’m free, I’ll make you regret it." />
		<string id="sansa4" text="}You think this is a victory? Holding me will not bring you the loyalty of the North. You may wear the crown for a time, but winter always comes." />
		<string id="yara4" text="}Go on, celebrate your little victory. But you’ve captured a Greyjoy, and that will cost you dearly. The sea remembers, and so do I." />
		<string id="margaery4" text="}Captured? I trust you’ll treat me as a guest rather than a prisoner. But know this, House Tyrell has long roots, and they will not be severed so easily." />
		<string id="mace4" text="}Captured? Hah! This will not last. The Reach has deep pockets and strong allies. You’ll regret underestimating House Tyrell, I assure you." />
		<string id="barristan4" text="}So, this is how it ends. But know this, you have not defeated me. I have served honorably, and my Queen will not let this injustice go unpunished." />
		<string id="stannis5" text="}You return? Good, Speak plainly, your duty is not to delay me. The Iron Throne is mine, and I will not rest until it is reclaimed." />
		<string id="mace5" text="}Ah, I see you’ve returned. I do hope it’s for something important. The Reach is vast and busy, and I don’t have time to waste on trivial matters. Speak quickly, and make it worth my time." />
		<string id="barristan5" text="}We meet again." />
		<string id="jorah5" text="}We meet again." />
		<string id="joffrey5" text="}Back again? You must think your presence here is worth my attention. Be quick about it, before I grow bored and have you thrown to the dogs, peasant." />
		<string id="edmure5" text="}You’re back." />
		<string id="tywin5" text="}You return." />
		<string id="jon5" text="}You again?" />
		<string id="renly5" text="}Ah, you return!" />
		<string id="alliser5" text="}Back again, are you? Let’s hope you’ve brought more than idle talk this time. The Watch has no patience for fools." />
		<string id="gregor5" text="}You again?" />
		<string id="dany5" text="}It is always nice to see a familiar face. Tell me, are you here to bend the knee?" />
		<string id="robb5" text="}You again?" />
		<string id="yara5" text="}You again? Either you’ve got a death wish, or you don’t know when to quit. Which is it this time?" />
		<string id="margaery5" text="}Ah, we meet again." />
		<string id="tormund5" text="}Back again, eh?" />
