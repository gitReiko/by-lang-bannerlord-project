I expect that {OTHER_MENTOR.LINK} is arming {?OTHER_MENTOR.GENDER}her{?}his{\?} allies in the gangs in that area. If the caravan delivers its load, then I expect we will soon find some of our friends stabbed to death in the streets by hired thugs, and the rest of our friends too frightened to acknowledge us. I need you to track it down and destroy it. Try to intercept it on the first leg of its journey, before it gets to {QUEST_TO_SETTLEMENT_NAME}. If you fail, find out the next town to which it is going. It may take some time to find it, and when you do, it will be well guarded.
