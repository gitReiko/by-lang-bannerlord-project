    <string id="0kDUOy2G" text="Ulikshorn lies beside the Jumne River as it cuts through the hills known as the Iltanhindrun, named because they posed a barrier to mountain tribes just across the frontiers. Those peoples were pushed farther south and absorbed into the Khuzait confederacy, leaving a considerable land trafficked only by nomadic herdsmen and raiders. The region is rich in wheat, barley and other grains." />
    <string id="1SnAH5K8" text="Rovalatys, in the mountains of the Ebor Peninsula, was never fully an imperial town. Nordic migrants, drawn to the region by rumors of riches to be made prospecting for silver or hunting for furs, long outnumbered Calradians even before the Vlandian invasion. The Vlandians too recognized its potential, and despite its harsh winters this land is among the more populous regions of the kingdom, with bountiful fields in the valleys of the mountains feeding the constant flow of settlers from the south drawn here by their hunger for wealth." />
    <string id="1ZMvRYTm" text="Chornad in the Neurval Valley, beneath the Biscan Hills. The villagers of this region, like many in the central Vlandian kingdom, specializing in raising pigs on the plentiful acorns that fall from the region's oak trees." />
    <string id="23fxNyp4" text="Tor Melina lies on a flank of the Morcomb, a valley at the northwestern edge of the Battanian realm. The slopes, well-drained and exposed to the sun, produce a fine crop of wheat." />
    <string id="2IZ3PZWZ" text="Hanekhy sits atop a northern spur of the Akkan Hills. Each day, the villagers climb down winding paths to tend their wheatfields in the plains below." />
    <string id="2pt8EBsS" text="Hakarshus was the first settlement on the northern coast of Beinland. Its founder, Hakar, harbored a resentment towards authority that was fierce even by local standards. His descendants have become walrus hunters and whalers, venturing to the far north, away from kings and jarls and taxes, in search of their quarry." />
    <string id="3u1Zy671" text="Varagos sits on the Aris River, which flows into the deep pool known as the Ophthys. Landowners here have planted mulberry bushes on the warm hillsides, on which they cultivate silkworms." />
    <string id="4aWgJfSi" text="Ostrif sits on a plateau on the eastern end of the Nordvyg coast. The villagers raise cattle on the grassy pastures above the sea-cliffs." />
    <string id="4awzygJb" text="Hertogea lies in the shadow of Mount Erithrys. Villagers grow olives on the slopes leading up the mountain. This region is home to a number of hot springs as well as caves that smell of the vapors of the earth. One of them - it is known not which - was home to a Palaic oracle who delivered a series of prophecies about the rise and eventual fall of the Empire. Imperial scholars with a mystical bent hotly debate which of the cryptic verses are authentic, and which ones are later inventions." />
    <string id="4ENGzVaC" text="The tale of Sarpea of Onira is one of the epic poems of the eastern frontier. Like many, it seems written to justify the Empire's conquest. Sarpea, a senator's daughter, was seized by a Palaic chieftain and carried to his citadel here. When the imperial armies appeared before its walls years later to rescue her, she begged them to retreat for the sake of her infant son, whom her fearsome husband had threatened to hurl from the walls instead of allowing him to be captured and raised by his mother's people. The legions withdrew, so the story says, but the boy grew into a warrior who joined the Empire and slew his father. The town is now the main trading center for the herders and miners of the eastern Tanaetic plain." />
    <string id="4fLQlZya" text="Gauksdal sits on the middle reaches of the Jumne, the river that the Khuzaits call the Karakaz. This stretch of valley is named in commemoration of Gauk, a local homesteader, who escaped a Khuzait ambush by swimming across the river in spring when it was choked with floating ice. Villagers now plant flax by the river's weedy shallows." />
    <string id="4L56zPos" text="The clifftop village of Skarthness is known for its intrepid mariners. While most of their neighbors are content to fish nearby banks, Skarthnessers voyage seasonally to the far north of Beinland on walrus hunts, bringing back valuable ivory." />
    <string id="4OAz8urz" text="Pen Cannoc sits on a promontory overlooking the Etircomb pass as it plunges from the Uchalion plateau into the Vlandian lowlands. Legends speak of the water-nymphs who live in springs that form in the cliffside, luring travellers and invaders to their deaths, except on those rare occasions when they fall in love with a hero and grant him victory and blessings. Certainly the people of this region have learned respect for the perils of the Etircomb, where a small misstep on slippery stone can cast one off a precipice into the gorge below." />
    <string id="5zqChoOb" text="Vinela on the landward side of the Epiric Hills, facing the Gavys River. Early morning sea-mists that come up the Gavys valley from the Perassic, together with the hot sun of midday, allow the growing of wine grapes." />
    <string id="6ygg4wPV" text="Erzenur sits alongside the east branch of the Tiagys River. It is known in the local dialect as the Kizil Teyagh from the strong reddish tint in the iron-rich sediments borne in its currents. Villagers will often divert the waters to wash away soil and expose new seams of ore." />
    <string id="8rKzYF3g" text="Nifdal is named for the dense mists that rise in the morning from the nearby Jumne river. The villagers here raise shaggy-haired cattle bred to withstand the bitter winters." />
    <string id="8UJ3cPrZ" text="Myzea gives its name to the Myzead, the mountainous highlands of the eastern Empire. This region is the old stomping grounds of the senator Litos, who brought the Palaic tribes here into the Empire relatively peacefully by offering them protection against raiders from the steppes. When he fell afoul of his rivals in the Senate, however, he tried to organize them into a rival 'barbarian' republic modelled on the ancient Calradian version. The empire snuffed it out, but the people here, now thoroughly Calradicized, still harbor an attachment to the old republican system and its partisans." />
    <string id="94c5GMQr" text="Ataconia sits near the headwaters of the Aris river in the piedmont of the Dryatic Mountains. The hills, rich with oak trees, are ideal for the raising of acorn-eating swine." />
    <string id="Aa6Ug1hj" text="Korsyas sits on the bay that the Sturgians call the Battanian Sea. Villagers here specialize in hunting blackfish, minke and other smaller whales that breed here in the protected waters." />
    <string id="AG9UT2dx" text="Dorstrand overlooks a grim gravel beach in the western end of the Nordvyg. Villagers earn their living by fishing cod, char and other arctic fish, including a variety of deepwater sharks whose flesh must be fermented before it is eaten." />
    <string id="ameOg5g7" text="Meroc overlooks a cove in the Biscan Coast. Like many villages in this region, its inhabitants fish nearby banks for mullet and cod for their day-to-day meals, while its bolder seafarers go much further into the western ocean to hunt more lucrative quarry, in particular whales." />
    <string id="aTMypBiY" text="Varnovapol, which sits beneath the Chertyg Mountains on the crystal waters of Lake Laconis, has the dubious honor of being perhaps the most-often conquered city in Calradia. Originally it was a colony of the Empire, infamous as a place of exile for dissident senators, before it was seized by Nords as a base to expand their influence into the Sturgian fur trade. It was taken by the Alkit tribe from the eastern steppe and briefly served as the capital of a small khanate, before finally falling to the fierce Ormidoving clan." />
    <string id="AvIb3tGu" text="The villagers of Holarsver fish the eastern Byalic Sea, where the runoff from the streams creates a brackish mix of saltwater and fresh. Here the catch consists of salmon, sea-trout and bottom-dwelling fish like flounder, caught in wicker traps. " />
    <string id="azr733J3" text="The seafaring village of Tharklif lies at the foot of a cliff overlooking the Byalic Sea. The inhabitants fish local stocks of char and cod, but are most known for their long-ranging voyages in pursuit of right whales and bowheads which migrate through these waters." />
    <string id="banXBv0D" text="The villagers of Kvol include the descendants of refugees and malcontents from across Calradia, seeking isolation in the cold northern forests. They grow barley for sustenance, but many far afield for seasonal work. Some join Nords and others on their walrus hunts in the far north." />
    <string id="bIhsm825" text="Carphenion lies in the rolling hills east of Mount Erithrys. On summer nights the hills above the village are dotted with the fires of cattle herders, taking their animals to graze on the upland pastures." />
    <string id="bnl7Va4c" text="Husn Fulq, Fulq's citadel, stands at the landward side of the Jabal al-Kals, the hills of bitterness, that divide the Aserai lands from the Empire. Fulq, also known as Phalcos, was a dark-faced mercenary chieftain who came from lands far to the south. He founded a fortress here and then parlayed its strategic location into a fortune, taking bribes from the Empire and then from the Aserai to switch sides. After 20 years of playing both sides back and forth he sailed home in a ship laden with gold, but many clans of the Aserai proudly claim descent from him, and the 'Tricks of Fulq' are a staple of many a bazaar storyteller's repetoire." />
    <string id="bPDqyqkb" text="Makeb sits on the northern tip of Lake Tanaesis, Tanaz in the steppe tongue. This city has long been ruled by petty khans and shahs, who collect tolls from traders forced to haul their boats around the rapids. The last of those rulers was beheaded by Urkhun himself after he refused a demand of tribute, after which the ruling family of the Khuzaits seized this town for themselves." />
    <string id="DJCei132" text="Thralathorp was settled by fugitives and runaways from various estates in the Jumne valley. It lies far to the east of the main Nord settlements, on the edge of the steppe. Isolation, freezing winters and frequent Khuzait raids ensure that there are few who would bother disputing their title. The people here make what money they can scraping clay from the bottom of the river in the months when the land is not frozen solid." />
    <string id="dVSR4l4D" text="Kjarved lies in the inland valleys of the western Nordvyg. Villagers tell stories of their famously foul-tempered and miserly ancestor Kjar, who came inland from the sea to escape a blood feud. For 60 years he mined salt from nearby deposits and accumulated a fabulous trove of wealth, all of which was a huge surprise to his dozens of children and grandchildren when they entered his modest farmhouse after his death to claim their inheritance." />
    <string id="dwkbyCqk" text="Grud was a thegn of the jarl of Hargard who established an outpost east of the Jumne River, which takes its name from the mysterious burial pits from some bygone people that lined its banks. The village named after him now herds sheep that range far out over the cold steppe to the east." />
    <string id="EaH59vf8" text="Fimbulgard was named for the beach-side shacks used to dry herring, the staple food of its seafaring inhabitants. The wealth of the village, however, comes from the seasonal voyages along the northern coasts in search of whales and their oil." />
    <string id="EaxhOE8Y" text="Zestea sits overlooking the Sethys River as it flows into the Perassic Sea. The conjoining of the waters makes for rich fishing grounds, for the shad and sardines who thrive in the brackish estuary waters as well as the tuna who come to eat them." />
    <string id="epJhvpdW" text="Hongard sits in the warm wooded lands near the meandering Trand River. This region, rich in wheat and once the heartland of the Empire, is now the center of the Vlandian kingdom." />
    <string id="eutVVgbR" text="Urunjan sits near the eastern edge of the Devseg plateau, at the foot of the Sulan Dag mountains. Villagers raise cattle here that are bred to withstand both the hot summers and freezing winters." />
    <string id="F5HlQdgf" text="Tyal sits atop a high valley that climbs Mount Iltan, a craggy peak in eastern Calradia named for a god of the steppe peoples. This region has long stood aloof from the power struggles of the other Sturgian principalities. Its people are known as wanderers, traders, horse breeders and fur-trappers. The local aristocracy has occasionally exchanged princesses with the steppe tribes to the east to firm up a truce or a trade pact, and proudly includes the names of several great khans on their list of ancestors." />
    <string id="f7tdonHz" text="The village of Esme and its surrounding hamlets lie on the landward side of the Akkan Hills on the Devseg plateau, prime grazing lands for the horses of the Khuzaits and their confederates." />
    <string id="fVkcvgSc" text="Vagnafit lies in a basin under the hills known as the Kjolfjallen, from their resemblance to the keel of a ship. The once boggy depression was drained under the orders of King Volbjorn, and the land distributed to some of the veterans who helped him gain power to grow wheat for Thronderlag and other towns." />
    <string id="FWgBOiaD" text="Gamardan sits at a key gap in the Epiric Hills, on the route between Charas and the imperial cities of the Aminys valley. The wines of this region are unusually sweet and strong, and valued throughout the Empire." />
    <string id="giPDsrGr" text="Ransam lies in the southern plains of the Devseg plateau. Villagers, who not long ago still lived a nomadic lifestyle, specialize in the rearing of horses." />
    <string id="h5tD3Cjj" text="Svinstak lies inland of the Nordvyg coast, separated from the sea by a row of sharp-ridged hills. Stands of old-growth oak and other trees are still common here, providing the north with much of the timber for its ships." />
    <string id="hBOy8ZUM" text="Hoeksten is named after a mysterious monolith found in the fields here by wandering herdsmen, subsequently ordered dug up by the local jarl and used in the foundations of Ykerslund Castle. He also ordered a village built on the auspicious site to settle refugees who had fled from the wars of Nord unification on the coast, and provided them with herds of cattle." />
    <string id="HvHbfLWH" text="Dagby lies in the heights above Gretysfjord. Residents of the town harvest the great oaks on the slopes for the town's shipbuilding industry. On the summer solstice, village youths race by riding the logs as they slide down the hill, risking mangled limbs or broken backs for a chance at glory." />
    <string id="i2VkRLBg" text="The former Nord colony of Varcheg sits on a windswept bluff at the base of the Kachyar Peninsula in what was once Battanian land. The jarl who founded this outpost, hoping to trade with the interior, pledged himself in fealty to the Battanian High King Dernmachad, but then proceeded to dabble in Battanian politics. Annoyed, Dernmachad hired a Sturgian army to crush his unreliable new vassal. The Sturgians complied and routed the Nords, but then demanded the newly captured town as their payment. They called the town 'Varcheg,' a corruption of the Nordic term for 'oathsworn companion,' to mock both rivals whose quarreling had handed them their prize." />
    <string id="INqm4EHB" text="Ravikayr sits on rich volcanic soil in the interior of Beinland. Here, on the lower slopes of the dark Oskfjal mountain, much of the island's supply of grain is grown." />
    <string id="J4bgNT0r" text="The legendary Queen Eshora, it is said, punished the jinn who were harassing her people by imprisoning them in one of the caves above Qasira, carving the mystical eight-pointed star into the rock to seal them in. She sentenced them to haul water from the depths of the earth, feeding the springs that gush forth from the rocks and which for centuries have irrigated the gardens of the Khisba, the small but rich coastal plain that adjoins the city." />
    <string id="j84R3OFX" text="The village of Agilting on the eastern shores of the Byalic Sea began as a gathering point for local fishers and herders to resolve their claims and feuds. Like many such sites in the north, it has evolved into a village as local populations grew." />
    <string id="JhBSnWAe" text="Ortysia, named for the quails who inhabit the nearby coastal marshes, was the first Calradian colony on the shores of the Perassic Sea. In its early centuries, it fell under the authority of the Kannic city-state of Quyaz, but the Empire's expansion soon united the colony with its mother republic. For centuries, sailors coming from the pirate-infested islands of the Gulf of Charas gave thanks when they saw its towers looming through the haze of the western Perassic, signalling a return to safe imperial-patrolled waters." />
    <string id="JJ0fLBlD" text="Jalskveg, in the east of the Nordvyg north of Thronderlag, lies on one of the main routes from the coast to the more sparsely populated interior. The area is thick with ancient oak trees, which are harvested and dragged to the coast by oxen for use in shipbuilding." />
    <string id="jlLJSudl" text="Ortongard sits near the eastern edges of the Devseg plateau. The land is dry for most of the year but offers rich grazing in the spring. Founded by Darshi-speaking merchants, it made its wealth buying horses, sheep and cattle from the surrounding herding villages and sending them west to the markets of the Empire in huge drives, accompanied by guards to ward off raiders from the steppes. Neither its walls nor its mercenary armies could withstand the coming of Khan Urkhun, however, who granted it to the Khergit clan in recognition of their valor." />
    <string id="jRaphKwi" text="Sirindac lies beneath the high ridges of the Ebor peninsula, somewhat sheltered from the bitter winds blowing out of the northwest. It was settled by prospectors hunting for silver in the mountain streams, but that has mostly been exhausted and the region now mostly exports clay for local potters." />
    <string id="jXBnf2hQ" text="Razih is said to be the base from which Kannic explorers set forth to colonize the shores of the Perassic Sea in the centuries before the coming of the Empire, the prows of their ships decorated with the intertwined vine leaves of the Kannic goddess of wealth, wine, love and war. Today, the Kannic tongue has been replaced by Nahasawi dialects and their religion is all but forgotten, but the symbol lives on, said to protect those who risk all for the sake of gain or glory." />
    <string id="K1XMpxea" text="Drapand sits near the tip of Cape Fal, a promontory just south of the mouth of the Trand River. The foremost seafaring village on this coast, it gives its name to the bay to its north. The villagers venture out far into the seas to hunt right and blackfish whales, and sometimes range as far north as Beinland chasing bowheads and narwhals." />
    <string id="kghCLS9q" text="Zeonica sits by the seaside at the base of the Iltaric Hills, a land of wine, grain and horses. It was named for the Lady Zeona, one of the few women to rule the Empire - admittedly as regent for her son rather than Empress Regnant. It is known for the Zeonic Wind, a gale that blows northward across the Perassic Sea every summer carrying the burning heat of the Nahasa desert to the imperial south. In other seasons the weather here is mild, a weather pattern that has provided many a poet with a metaphor for the transience of passion." />
    <string id="KtN9VSiR" text="Mjallagdal sits in a thickly wooded valley inland from Gretysfjord. Trees in these woods are often marked with the glyph of an horned archer carved into the bark, the work of a villager invoking the help of the god Ulthin in their hunt for marten, squirrel and other fur-bearing animals." />
    <string id="Lg5rbZse" text="Thronderlag was the gathering place of the Throndar, the legendary progenitors of the Nordic realm. Here, overlooking the sea, the clans would assemble on the cold spring equinox to resolve their disputes, choose a target for summertime raiding, and elect a warleader. Today the Nord king takes counsel mainly with a select group of his jarls in his hall, and such great assemblies are no longer held, but Thonderlag remains the symbolic center of the Nordvyg. " />
    <string id="LkKDVSJa" text="Ruvenbrek sits in the far northeast of the lands settled by the Nords. Rich deposits of iron ore in the soil here, their wealth visible from rust-brown streaks on hillsides or in the waters of bogs, have drawn migrants to this otherwise remote and forbidding region. " />
    <string id="mSaQ0Cof" text="Ykerslund is one of the northernmost districts of the Nordic kingdom. Its first inhabitants settled around a grove sacred to a wilderness goddess, and every year sacrifice in the hope of receiving her blessing to hunt in nearby woods." />
    <string id="N8ranMLF" text="Oristocorys lies on a peninsula west of the Bay of Ortysia. The village sits high on a slope to avoid both mosquitos from coastal marshes and raiding corsairs from the south, but the villagers make their way each morning to the sheltered covers where they keep their boats and set out to catch tuna, swordfish and other large species that migrate through the bay." />
    <string id="nhmBQIC4" text="Ocs Hall is one of the few towns in the Vlandian kingdom that was founded after the seizure of the land from the Empire. This valley was once an isolated holdout of Battanians, centered on the Llyn Modris, a marshy pool said to be the court of a watery spirit-queen to whom the peoples of the region made offerings. It was conquered however by the Vlandian warlord Oca, who drained the pool for farmland and built his great hall on the heights above. The Battanian tribes were driven inland, over the Rhennod, and took their legends with them." />
    <string id="Nx0qK2g6" text="Paravenos was the second major colony founded by Calradios the Great, and it soon succeeded Charasea as the capital of the Calradians. Eventually, the Empire's center of gravity moved east, but Paravenos retained its primacy as the economic center of the West. When Osric Iron-Arm the Vlandian invaded, he recognized Paravenos would be far more valuable as a seat of power than as simply as a source of loot,  and negotiated its surrender with local senators. It passed to a cadet branch of Osric's line, the dey Tihr clan, and is today known as Pravend." />
    <string id="nxmX99pO" text="Gretysfjord is perhaps the oldest walled town in the Nordvyg, yet there are greybeards here who claim their grandsires were among the first to settle here permanently. At first it was but a seasonal market by the shore, drawing in traders from across the seas, until a local chief built walls and a great hall and began calling himself jarl. It is still the most frequented port on the Nordvyg, a welcome refuge to sailors from the unpredictable and cold northern seas." />
    <string id="OAK0kjBo" text="Mot lies in the Neurval, a valley that runs between the Biscan and Epiric hills, known for the blaze of poppies that cover its slopes in the spring. The warm lands of the Vlandian south are well-suited to the growing of olives." />
    <string id="OBPnMiGG" text="The village of Lagshofn was founded by the explorer and trade Lag, who cast his seat-pillars into the sea and followed them to this spot. His intrepid descendants sail from here into the straits between Hvalvik and Vlandia, where they hunt right whales, blackfish and other quarry on their migration routes between the Byalic Sea and the northern ocean. " />
    <string id="ozyk0Toa" text="Troverag is a mining colony in the bleak hills overlooking the Byalic Sea. The dour inhabitants are known for laboring long into the night, and the glow of their forges can be seen far from shore." />
    <string id="pbHXtJ82" text="Omor sits on the eastern shores of Lake Laconis. Long before the Sturgians formed themselves into a principality it was a holy site for the forest tribes, who worshipped their gods and ancestors in the sacred oak trees of the nearby woods. Today, it is an emporium for fur trappers and woodsmen, and the primeval peace of the forests is drowned out by the sounds of bartering, saws, and the unloading of ships at the lake." />
    <string id="pk7L6pkL" text="Khimli sits in a basin in the Devseg plateau. Though this land is dry most of the year, it experiences winter snowfalls and muddy springs. Fine clay can be collected from the pools left by the snowmelt and the rains." />
    <string id="PKlv8jCB" text="Faergap lies on the passage through the bleak hills that divide the eastern coasts of the Byalic Sea from the Jumne valley. As the pass crests, and the rich lands of the Jumne come into view, a traveller can read runic inscriptions carved on boulders by Nordic migrants, giving thanks to the gods for their safe journey." />
    <string id="PPadNxa6" text="Sibir was founded on the seaward slopes of the Chertyg Mountains by Nordic traders, who wished a base to buy furs from the local Vakken-speaking foresters. As the Sturgian tribes became principalities, and elected chieftains evolved into boyars who demanded taxes and labor as their due, this region became a magnet for Sturgians who had little taste for deference. Today, the ambitious Isyaroving family governs this region, but they must always balance their hunger for wealth and men to fight their wars with their subjects' reluctance to provide it." />
    <string id="ptaZeOkf" text="Arromanc lies in the Neurval, a valley that runs between the Biscan and Epiric hills. The warm lands of the Vlandian south, where the air smells of sage, lavender and thyme, are well-suited to the growing of olives." />
    <string id="Q3lvcUub" text="Vorfjall lies on the hills east of the Jumne, known for the bloom of purple lupin that fill the highland meadows in the late spring. The village sustains itself mining salt from deposits, some in vibrant streaks of color, that can be found in the nearby hills." />
    <string id="Q8OUGbzw" text="Elvania overlooks the estuary of the Aminys River. Hot southern afternoons and sea-cooled mornings make this good country for wine grapes." />
    <string id="QD3oaaNK" text="Car Banseth sits on the bay that the Battanians used to call Muir Mon. The seafaring clans of this coast claim that the ancestors of the Battanians came across these waters to settle their lands. They say that those who keep faith will one day witness from this high point the ships of the vanished High King Mon, who shall return to deliver his people from their enemies. But today, they call it the Muir Gal, the foreigner's sea, as one is far more likely to see the sails of Nordic adventurers and mercenaries, coming to join Sturgians, Vlandians and others in their relentless push into Battanian land." />
    <string id="rKW7FqWa" text="Midskag is named after the cape that lies roughly halfway from the western end of the Nordvyg to the capital of Thronderlag. The villagers of the region near Midskag make their living from the sea, harvesting cod and ice-char from nearby banks." />
    <string id="RL2vacqv" text="Phycaon sits at the head of the Sethys valley, one of the main grain-producing regions of the central Empire. Once the largest of the Palaic cities, its leaders led a league of the tribes against imperial encroachment into the region. But when the Empire's victory looked inevitable, they made their peace. The population, now thoroughly Calradicized, have a reputation for being serious, respectable and trade-minded, dependable if a bit humorless." />
    <string id="s7XNUFCD" text="Kargrev was once Car Gryff, the ringfort of the Battanian chief Gryff, but was conquered by the Sturgians two generations ago. Recently, the most intrepid of the villagers have joined Nords and others who go every summer to the far north, to Beinland and beyond, in search of walrus ivory." />

    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_S7_2" text="Karbur sits at a plateau on the Kachyar Peninsula. Sheltered somewhat by a high ridge to their north, the villagers here raise barley and grain." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_S7_3" text="Zhemyan lies on the ridge that forms the spine of the Kachyar Peninsula. The rich grassy fields of this region make it a prime spot for local landowners to raise horses." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V1_2" text="Echarfurd sits on the northern slopes of the Epiric Hills. Unlike most settlements in the kingdom, it was founded by Vlandian migrants, who named it after a settlement in their old homeland. The villagers here grow wheat, finding a ready market in the garrisons stationed nearby." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V1_3" text="Rodetan takes its name from the ruddy, iron-rich soil of this part of the the Biscan Hills. The mines of this district supply the iron ore for many of the forges of the Vlandian kingdom." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V2_1" text="Mareiven sits in the Vlandian coastal lowlands, beneath the hills of the Rhennod. Villagers harvest the tall trees of the heights, selling the logs to cities on the coast." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V2_2" text="Oritan sits high in the Rhennod, the western escarpment of the Uchalion massif. The families of this region trace their descent to Vlandian mercenaries who intermarried with local hill peoples related to the Battanians." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V2_3" text="Fregian sits in a shallow valley near Ocs Hall. Villagers plant flax on boggy land that was once a marshy lake before it was drained by the Vlandian barons." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V2_4" text="Marin lies on the edges of the broad valley of the meandering Trand. Misty mornings cooled by sea drifting south and warm afternoons make this land well-suited to the growing of grapes." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V3_2" text="Rulund sits in the windswept coasts north of the Trand River. Although there are few forests in these parts for the pigs to root, they thrive on the rye and wheat grown on the downs by the sea." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V3_4" text="Palisont sits close to where the Trand River meets the sea. The cool sea air that flows upriver and the warm afternoons allow the growing of wine grapes." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V5_1" text="Furbec sits on a shelf overlooking the rocky Biscan coast of central Vlandia. The climate is warm most of the year, and grapes do well on the slopes of the Biscan Hills." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V7_1" text="Savinth sits on a wooded hillside north of the Gulf of Charas. Just down the slope lies fine pasture for the renowned horses of the Vlandians." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V7_2" text="The village of Vesin lies by a creek running down from the Epiric Hills to the Gulf of Charas. This warm land is well-suited to the growing of olive trees." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V8_2" text="Cananc lies in the wet wooded hills of the Ebor Peninsula, where yew trees grow tall in the sea-mists. The village is known for producing fine pigs, who are allowed to range through the thick woods rooting for acorns, chestnuts and grubs. Towering fir and spruce grow on the slopes. This rule of of the Vlandian barons in this rugged land is much lighter than in the south, attracting many migrants who value the relative freedom." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V8_3" text="Remental sits on a ledge of the Ebor Peninsula, overlooking the sea. Vlandian settlers originally here came to mine silver, but those ores were quickly exhausted. Desperate prospectors were able to locate some deposits of salt, which was much in demand as the coasts here are generally too steep for the creation of salt pans." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V9_1" text="Alantas sits in the center of the mountainous Ebor Peninsula. The soil here is thin and the weather here is cold, but rich iron deposits sustain the local economy." />
    <string id="Settlements.Settlement.text.village_V9_2" text="Halisvust was once a bog amid the scrubby coastal woods at the base of the Ebor Peninsula, but Vlandian settlers drained the waters and sowed wheat and rye." />
    <string id="shrCpiut" text="Talivel lies in the middle of the Trand valley in the Vlandian heartland. Villagers plant olives here on the hillsides." />
    <string id="T2E4xKVn" text="Revyl, chief town of the rocky Kachyar Peninsula, was a traditional rival of Balgard. According to legend the Balgardian princess Arkina, whose husband had been slain by the Revylians, accepted a proposal from her enemy's king to marry and settle the feud. On her wedding night, however, she barred the door of his hall and burned him and a hundred of his kinsmen and warriors alive inside. The feud has long since been settled by pacts and marriages with happier outcomes, although Revylians still resent the ascent of the Balgardian Gundaroving dynasty." />
    <string id="TKeLjx14" text="Haugr sits on the eastern branch of the Jumne River, where it meanders over its floodplain. It was named after a stone cairn on a riverside bluff, said by locals to have been built by trolls from the nearby tundra. The region produces fine, dark clays, much prized by local potters." />
    <string id="TrAqb5E9" text="Calioc sits in the Neurval, the valley between the Epiric and Biscan Hills. The people of this district grow flax on the wet valley floor." />
    <string id="UCrwAaba" text="Galend overlooks the wave-beaten Biscan coast. It takes in the catch from the Biscan's intrepid fishermen and whalers who venture out far into the western ocean, as well as the wool of sheep from the green fog-covered hills. The current line of Vlandian kings comes from the clans who settled in this region during Osric Iron-Arm's invasion." />
    <string id="udB5YibE" text="Omrotok sits at the foot of the Sulun Dag mountains, which mark the eastern border of the Devseg plateau. Villagers go to the nearby woods to harvest one of the Devseg's few sources of timber." />
    <string id="UEIJSj9y" text="Gripsby, on the east coast of Beinland, was founded early in the island's settlement by mainlanders who hunted walrus on nearby beaches. These days they must venture farther afield, to the north of Beinland and the frozen seas beyond, but they still take a rich haul of valuable ivory." />
    <string id="UIrbLGBx" text="The village of Nogrent sits high on a ridge overlooking the Biscan coast. Grapes grown here are pressed to make a sturdy wine, a key ingredient in the hearty fishermen's soups for which the Biscan region is famous." />
    <string id="VbQhrOU9" text="Karahalli lies in the far north of the Khuzait confederacy, in borderlands contested by Sturgians and Nords. Though the winters are cold, the spring grasses are fine grazing for the local sheep, whose thick wool protects them from the region's piercing winds." />
    <string id="vTBy6iqW" text="The fishing village of Aalgrun is known for the eels that thrive in the offshore shallows. Slightly further out to sea fishermen also find herring, as well as char that migrates to the sea from nearby streams to spawn." />
    <string id="w6hCZS3K" text="Ormanfard sits at the foot of the Ormanthal, a pass that leads to the Battanian lands. Rains are plentiful and wheat and barley grow well on the hillsides, but villagers are always alert for the sounds of horns from the castle guarding the pass, warning of Battanian raiders." />
    <string id="WGtzBswe" text="The natural fortress of Lycaron sits on a spur jutting out of the great Ornian rock. In the final years of the imperial conquest, the Palaic tribe here negotiated a peaceful federation with the Empire, only to see their home seized by the rebel leader Gethuz. The ensuing siege was only the first of many that Lycaron would undergo in the ensuing centuries, as its nearby silver mines made it a prize for every imperial pretender who ever tried to seize power in a civil war. It is said that the colony of vultures who inhabit the upper reaches of the Rock have dined on the flesh of every people of Calradia." />
    <string id="xkkI7ejQ" text="The frontier city of Danustica has long defended the eastern reaches of the Empire, holding the line against incursions by the Aserai and various Darshi shahs and padishahs further to the east. Many an imperial legionary stationed here has scribbled graffiti on its walls cursing the city's sweltering summers, brackish water and mosquitos, but the inhabitants are proud of their role as border defenders and mock the soldiers wilting in the heat around them." />
    <string id="Xom9DeXZ" text="Balgard, which sits on the icy waters of the Byalic Sea, was founded by migrants from the Nordvyg. Legend holds that the initial wave of Nords arrogantly demanded tribute from the nearby Vakken and Sturgian tribes, who formed an alliance and drove the newcomers back to their ships. But the victors fell out over the spoils, until a canny Nord, Gundar, landed and volunteered to help them fairly divvy up the weapons and armor of his dead kinsmen. The residents recognized Gundar's lordship over the region and his descendants, intermarried with the Sturgians, are today the grand princes of Sturgia." />
    <string id="Y5YbDNKp" text="The village of Draugmyr takes its name from a nearby bog that was once a place of sacrifice. Though long since drained to create farmland, its rich wheatfields still turn up the odd bone or golden grave-offering." />
    <string id="YHbN2pKZ" text="Marathea lies in a valley in the Dryatic Mountains, overlooking Lake Laconis. The villagers are skilled miners, and the red streaks running down the nearby cliffsides are evidence of rich iron ores." />
    <string id="yOezgAaK" text="Laxahof sits on a low promontory that juts into the Byalic Sea, on the war-torn marches that divide the Sturgian and Nordic lands. In past generations its inhabitants made their living by signing on to dangerous, freezing whaling ventures organized by Byalic Sea merchants. Rrecently they have begun to organize their own voyages, bringing home wealth to what was once one of the poorest corners of the north." />
    <string id="yowxgqGD" text="The village of Bjorenbyr on the downs of western Beinland was founded only two generations ago, as the people of Beinland began to settle inland. It harvests the old-growth forests of the highlands, where great trees might still be found, and are much valued by shipbuilders on the coast and the mainland." />
    <string id="ytBRXqt8" text="Vostrum was founded by the Calradian mercenary Archacos, one of a number of rogue commanders who broke away from the Empire during its expansion. Unlike some, who tried to reproduce the Empire's republican heritage, he chose to rule as a god-king. His dynasty lasted for generations, until imperial troops overran it and smashed every haloed statue of Archacos and his successors into rubble. Even today, western and northern imperial senators accuse families from this region of being closet monarchists." />
    <string id="YYYxOiCq" text="Amprela is the foremost town of the northeastern Empire. Watchmen stand atop its towers, looking out for beacons from the frontier fortresses to the north and east that might signal the approach of enemies. Horse archers recruited from the rough Eleftheroi freemen drink in the barracks, waiting for the order to ride out against Khuzait steppe-riders, Sturgian woodsmen or Nord longships coming down the Caracasos River, while the cataphracts drill in the courtyard of the keep and ensure their horses are in fighting trim should the archon need to assemble an army to deal with any larger threat." />
    <string id="zh2tG1MX" text="Nordic tribes pushing into the dark forests to their east founded the citadel of Hargard several generations ago. It overlooks the river that the Nords call the Jumne, probably a derivation of a Sturgian term for the mysterious burial pits found along its banks. Today, the river forms the main artery of transportation for the Nord kingdom's eastern domains, a meeting-place of Nords, Vakken, Sturgians, and even some forest-dwelling cousins of the steppe tribes, all harvesting the wealth of the river-valley to sell to the peoples of the south." />
    <string id="Zn9NwSTf" text="Hvalvik is the main port on the remote northern island known to the Nords as Beinland, the land of bones. It is debated whether the island's namesake comes from the walrus ivory that drew hunters here, or the only trace that many left behind, buried in shallow graves alongside its bleak gravel-covered shores. In the last few generations, however, a run of milder winters and a growing mainland population has encouraged colonists to seek their fortune in Beinland, and the former cluster of whalers' huts known as Hvalvik is now a thriving town." />
    <string id="znRLc4v1" text="Montos sits near the headwaters of the Aminys River, close to the Battanian frontier. The farmers here keep a watchful eye when tending their hillside fields, always looking for raiding parties coming westward from the valley of the Miron River to their east." />
