There is a wide-ranging diaspora of around five million people of full or partial Armenian ancestry living outside modern Armenia. In 885 CE the Armenians reestablished themselves as a sovereign kingdom under the leadership of Ashot I of the Bagratid Dynasty. A considerable portion of the Armenian nobility and peasantry fled the Byzantine occupation of Bagratid Armenia in 1045, and the subsequent invasion of the region by Seljuk Turks in 1064. They settled in large numbers in Cilicia, an Anatolian region where Armenians were already established as a minority since Roman times. In 1080, they founded an independent Armenian Principality then Kingdom of Cilicia, which became the focus of Armenian nationalism."/>

The Eastern Balts consisted of Samogitia, Lithuania, Selonia, Semigallia and Latgalia ethnicities. No one ethnos had a unified state. Many principalities traded, allied and fought each other. In case of threat the principalities created alliances, for example, in 1106 Semigallians defeated a large army of Polatsk and stopped its expansion into their region. The Northern Crusades stopped the natural process of formation of the Baltic States. Some ethnicities were destroyed, others conquered, the rest united to fight a common enemy. Today exists two Baltic nations, Latvia and Lithuania. Lithuania was able to create a powerful state and unite many Baltic and Slavic ethnic groups. Latvia was formed from the Teutonic Order, which conquered the Balts during the Northern Crusades."/>

Over time, these settlers were assimilated and became the Norse-Gaels. After the Norman invasion of 1169–71, large swathes of Ireland came under the control of Norman lords, leading to centuries of conflict with the native Irish. The King of England claimed sovereignty over this territory – the Lordship of Ireland – and the island as a whole. However, the Gaelic system continued in areas outside Anglo-Norman control. The territory under English control gradually shrank to an area known as the Pale and, outside this, many Hiberno-Norman lords adopted Gaelic culture."/>

  <string id="E11BUL_desc" text="The Bulgars were Turkic semi-nomadic warrior tribes that flourished in the Pontic–Caspian steppe and the Volga region during the 7th century. They became known as nomadic equestrians in the Volga-Ural region, but some researchers believe that their ethnic roots can be traced to Central Asia. During their westward migration across the Eurasian Steppe, the Bulgar tribes absorbed other tribal groups and cultural influences in a process of ethnogenesis, including Iranic, Finnic, and Hunnic tribes. The Bulgars spoke a Turkic language, the Bulgar language of the Oghuric branch. They preserved the military titles, organization, and customs of Eurasian steppes as well as pagan shamanism and belief in the sky deity Tangra. The Bulgars became semi-sedentary during the 7th century in the Pontic-Caspian steppe, establishing the polity of Old Great Bulgaria c. 630–635, which was defeated by the Khazar Empire in 668 AD. In c. 679, Khan Asparukh conquered Scythia Minor, opening access to Moesia, and established the Danubian Bulgaria – the First Bulgarian Empire, where the Bulgars became a political and military elite. They merged subsequently with established Byzantine populations, as well as with previously settled Slavic tribes, and were eventually Slavicized, thus becoming one of the ancestors of modern Bulgarians."/>

  <string id="E11BYZ_desc" text="The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantium, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in its eastern provinces during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople. It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Empire in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire remained the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. The terms Byzantine Empire and Eastern Roman Empire were coined after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire, and to themselves as Romans — a term which Greeks continued to use for themselves into Ottoman times. Although the Roman state continued and its traditions were maintained, modern historians prefer to differentiate the Byzantine Empire from Ancient Rome as it was centered on Constantinople and not Rome, oriented towards Hellenic culture, and characterised by Eastern Orthodox Christianity instead of Roman Catholicism or Paganism."/>

  <string id="dregoviandescription" text="The Dregoviches are originally associated with the Zarubintsy culture (3 century BC – 2 century AD). As the Ice Age progressed into the territory of modern Belarus, the Zarubinians moved to the Balkans. In the Balkans they became known as Draguvites (Drougoubitai). After the end of the Ice Age, some of the Draguvites migrated back to Belarus. But the area was already settled by other ethnicities. After the Draguvites mixed with these ethnicities, the Dregoviches were formed. Modern genetic research has confirmed this hypothesis: the Dregoviches have a 50% Balkan component. Before the 10th century Dregoviches already had their own state. The Turaŭ (Turov) Principality was formed on its basis. From the 10th century to 1158 the Turaŭ Principality was conquered by Rus. From 1158 the independence of the state was restored. But Rus constantly tried to capture Turaŭ. By the beginning of the 13th century, Turaŭ had fallen into vassal dependence on the Rus Kingdom (Galicia). To liberate themselves, the Dregoviches made an alliance with Lithuania and joined it as an autonomy. During more than 500 years in the Lithuanian state, the Dregoviches mixed with other Belarusian ethnicities and formed the Belarusian nation."/>

The kryvians left many archaeological monuments, such as the remnants of agricultural settlements with traces of ironworks, jeweler's art, blacksmith's work and other handicrafts; long burial mounds of the 6th to 9th centuries with cremated bodies; burial mounds of rich warriors with weapons; sets of distinctive jewelry. The kryvians are a largest Eastern European tribal union. It consisted mainly of Slavic and Baltic tribes. It also had Finns and Normans components. Over time, the culture divided into three branches: Połack (Polatsk), Smolensk and Pskov. In the second half of the 10th century the kryvians formed the Połack State, which existed for more than 500 years, from the second half of the 13th century as an autonomy within Lithuania. The kryvians greatly influenced on the forming of the Belarusian ethnos and the existence of the state. Nowadays kryvians are part of the Belarusian and Russian ethnoses. This ethnos also includes the Radimichs, as their history is closely intertwined with the kryvians. Over time, the synthesis of kryvians and Radimichs was named Belarussians. Over time, this name spread to modern Belarus."/>

Second, Rus as ethnos which has created the state and from which the name of the state has gone. Russian scientist Boris Rybakov has analyzed all chronicles of the Rus period and has defined on what territory the population considered itself as Rus, and on what opposed itself to Rus. These data were correlated with archaeological cultures. Initially ethnoses of Severians and Polans considered themselves as Rus. In the 13th century Volhynians and White Croats began to consider themselves as Rus. But in the 13th century Rus as a state in most of the territory of the former empire stopped to exist. In the 13th-14th centuries, the third definition of Rus starts to use widely. Rus as an Orthodox person. In the religious meaning of an Orthodox person, the term extends to the territory of modern Belarus and Russia. Later, the term changed its meaning many times and had many meanings at the same time. In this mod only ethnoses of Severians and Polans are considered as Rus. They are the core of this civilization in the timeline."/>

  <string id="E11welsh_desc" text="A distinct Welsh culture emerged among the Celtic Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales was briefly united under Gruffydd ap Llywelyn in 1055. After over 200 years of war, the conquest of Wales by King Edward I of England was completed by 1283, though Owain Glyndŵr led the Welsh Revolt against English rule in the early 15th century, and briefly re-established an independent Welsh state with its own national parliament.
