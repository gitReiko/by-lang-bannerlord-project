    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader009" text="In this age of conflict, from the south horizon with endless black land, an otherworldly evil thrive." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader010" text="Continue" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader011" text="Just when human beings thought that they had stabilized their territory, in the black lands where no one noticed, evil forces pirece the whole continent like arrows." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader012" text="Continue" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader013" text="The whole continent has once again fallen into endless wars and chaos. Darkness and despair spread to the whole continent. At this time, human beings could barely survive in the shadow." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader014" text="Continue" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader015" text="Just when all hope seems dissipated, mankind finally launched the final decisive battle. The sword of the hero collided with the evil force at the last moment, and with the blood of the hero came the light of tomorrow!" />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader017" text="But peace didn't follow, the insidious conspiracy, the conflict between faith, the mankind struggle against each other." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader018" text="Continue" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader019" text="There is a new tide of war between the human civlization. The path of future is unclear." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader020" text="Interesting story, so who rule the continet in our time?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader021" text="Now there are 8 main factions in the continet, the legions of Wulltes and kingdom of Nekenia in the north, Mogrian tribes and lomoca Shogunate in the center, Emirate of rabblam, Prouen federation, Yan dynasty and Yarian witch kings in the south, they all rule a part of the continet." />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader023" text="The main territory of this continent is occupied by them, but this continent is said to be the first continent in the world, where many races and factions were born and died. It is said that many factions have disappeared from the public's eyes, but as far as I know, their forces may not be weaker than those of these countries!" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader024" text="I see. no more questions for now." />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader025" text="{PLAYER.NAME}, are you still alive?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader026" text="I guess I survived the onslaught, and how did you survived that?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader027" text="I am a merchant, I found a place to hide last night." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader028" text="Ha, I guess that means you run for your life! Then why are you coming back?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader029" text="I understand, Then why are you coming back?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader030" text="There's an important letter in my cargo. I must recover it from those bandits." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader031" text="What's your plan?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader032" text="I guess you will have a chance if last night they didn't launch a suprise attack. I have some money left in my pocket. You can recruit some soldiers in the nearby villages, and I know their direction. If you can defeat those bandits, half of my cargo will be yours." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader033" text="I'll try." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader034" text="Of course, let's begin." />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader035" text="{PLAYER.NAME}, looks like we now have enough troop to strike them." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader036" text="What should I do for now?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader037" text="They should be near the village they attacked us." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader038" text="Ok, let's go." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader039" text="I know, wait for me." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader040" text="My intel suggest they scattered around the village, we can sneak around them and use suprise element to divide and conquer." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader041" text="Okey." />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader042" text="Thank you,{PLAYER.NAME}, here are the cargo I promised you." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader043" text="So, what's next?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader044" text="I think I will sell the remaining cargo in the town." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader045" text="Did you find that letter?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader046" text="Of course, now I must heading to the nearest town and sell the cargo, you will find me in the tavern." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader047" text="Okey." />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader048" text="Finally, you come, I thought you were escaped." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader049" text="What happened?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader050" text="What happened? did you know we just attacked the slavers?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader051" text="I know, who are they?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader052" text="And you saved one of their slave? don't you know you are playing with fire? Oh, we are doomed! didn't find out who they are before we act will be our last mistake!" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader053" text="What happened, you look so scared." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader054" text="Yes, the slavers, they control all the slave trade in this land, every kingdom support them! There used to be a king of a small kingdom, who fall in love with a slave, and he asked the slavers to set her free, then, you know what happened?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader055" text="They free her?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader056" text="Of course not you idiot, instead, the slavers conquer that country, every single survivor become slave. All the faction in this continent support these bastards, If I were you I'll free that slave and escape as fast as I can." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader057" text="I won't escape." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader058" text="I have tell you what I must. the slavers won't let us go. Oh, the letter, I think you should take it, I will go to another continent. also here are 2000 dinars, as Compensation, If I know they are the slavers's member, I won't get you involved, farewell." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader059" text="(Take the letter and coins.)" />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader060" text="I will leave soon, see you next time." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader061" text="I want to know who the slavers is?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader062" text="I know, take care!" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader063" text="Frankly, I don't know who's really behind them either, the only thing I know is the slavers trade slaves all across the continent, no matter war prisoner or debt slave. If you were enslaved by them, you will be a slave for life, and you can only serve the master buy you from the slavers. They will hunt you down if you want to escape or disobey your master. Few can escape from such hunt, maybe they escape to the other continents. Because the slavers reward those who help them generously, and every kingdom's slave trade are count on them. that's all I know about them." />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader064" text="If that's all, I think we must go." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader065" text="Okey." />

    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1207" text="Okey." />

    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1301" text="Master, have you got the hardwoods we need?" />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1302" text="Here you are, 10 unit of hardwoods, is that enough?" />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1303" text="I haven't finished it yet." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1304" text="Of course, thank you my master." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1305" text="Anything else I can help?" />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1306" text="Yes, my master, we are slave, so we can't trade in towns, I hope you can buy some supply for us in the nearby market. Also, I want to tell you we have finish the construction of your mansion." />

    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1402" text="I am no slave master, don't call me master." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1403" text="You saved me, and you will be my master (one of your solider tell you prisoner like her will be marked with the 'mark of slave' on their hands, that means they are slave for life.) " />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1404" text="Do you have such mark?" /> 
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1405" text="Yes, my master." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1406" text="Forget about that 'mark', I set you free in the name of your master." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1407" text="Is that mark so powerful?" />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1408" text="I am afraid you don't know the slavers at all." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1409" text="Well. What kind of force are they?" />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1410" text="Those bastard, they are a group of slave trader, they trade slaves all across the land, even the great kingdoms don't want to enrage them, I guess you are not born in this continent, or you will know them." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1411" text="So, you are still a slave even if I saved you from those slavers?" />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1412" text="Yes, I got the mark of slave on my hand and neck, that means I am a slave for life, and I must serve a master, or the slavers will hunt me down and sell me to a new master." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1413" text="No other solution?" />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1414" text="Yes, we have an option, destory the slavers! (You can feel the anger in her eyes)" />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1415" text="So, what's you story? why you become their slave?" />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1416" text="They attacked our village, take us as slaves. My mother, father, grandfather and grandmother, All killed in the raid." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1417" text="You can follow my party." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1418" text="I think you should find a new master." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1419" text="You already make slavers your enemy, they won't let you go. My people, they are still hold by the slavers, but they know how to destory the slavers. If you save my people, we will be your servant." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1420" text="Where are they, I'll try." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1421" text="Wish your people won't let me down." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1422" text="They are hold as prisoner in the slaver outpost nearby, If you are ready, I can lead the way." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1423" text="Let's go." />

    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1501" text="Thank you for saving my people, master." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1502" text="I told you no need to call me master, I have saved your people, so what shall we do next? we got some many slavers to fight." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1503" text="Don't worry my master, the slavers destoryed my people's home. Master is our only hope, we will help you, I promise. Our elder know how to deal with the slavers." />

    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1601" text="Welcome back, master." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1602" text="Anything I can do for you? do you have enough supply now?" />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1603" text="Yes, we now have enough supply. Also, a man who claim he is a member of the knights of sika offered his help, he give us two Spiritual beasts." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1604" text="Spiritual beasts?" />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1605" text="Yes, master, those creatures was breed by the knights of sika, they can help you party in the battle, the knight bring us a spiritual cat and spiritual dog, you can choose one." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1606" text="Okey, let me see." />

    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1701" text="Master, something I can help?" />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1702" text="Can you tell me what's wrong with Icey? Ardron asked me to look after her, but she just tell me she doesn't want to talk with anyone." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1703" text="That armstong, how dare is he, ask master to do such thing, I think our elder will punish him again. Master… you saved us from the slavers, but Icey… poor Icey, her parents and her brothers, they return to the arms of the gods. in front of her eyes, in the day the slavers attacked our village, I think that makes her sunk in the sea of sadness, but after we settled her, she looks better." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1704" text="I understand, tell the elder don't punish him, I just want to help you." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1705" text="I know it, and I am your master, tell Ardron don't bother me with such matter again." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1706" text="Yes, my master, as our elder say, you have a heart of gold." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1707" text="Sorry, master. We won't bother you with such matter." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1708" text="Do you think we can help her?" />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1709" text="Sorry, I don't know, but I think you can ask Navi, the bravest boy of the village, he is younger than Icey, and his parents returned to the gods too. He succeed his father's position as our oracle, other children say he possess the ability as an oracle, but he refuse to show it to others. His father failed to foreseen the attack of the slavers, so nobody believes the oracle after that. But I think he can help Icey." />
    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1710" text="Okey, I'll ask him." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader001" text="Dear master, Sally has told us your deeds, I, in the name of all the sikans, would like to express our thanks to you." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader002" text="Of course, destory the slavers and save the slaves like you is my goal." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader003" text="You are welcome, I just do what I must." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader004" text="Ha, I guess without me you will be slave for life!" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader005" text="Your purpose and attitude doesn't matter, the important thing is you have done a deed no one dare to do. And we, the sikan, will serve you." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader006" text="Sally, what's your plan against the slavers?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader007" text="The slavers are powerful, but, I'm sure we have a way to destory them." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader008" text="So, at last we can't escape our fate, I'm sorry master, I shouldn't get you involved…" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader009" text="No, I will try to save you either if I have a second chance. The only difference is I will get well prepared." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader010" text="I shouldn't come to save you if I can foresee the situation, threre's no hope." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader011" text="Master, I think you can try to escape with sally, she will be honored if she can protect master from some arrows, then master will have a better chance to survive, If you managed to escape with sally alive, then the sikans will live on." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader012" text="I hope so, but we are surrounded and outnumbered, I'm afraid I can't make it in such circumstances." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader013" text="I won't escape, because I choose to fight, then I will fight to the very last moment." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader014" text="I can't left you to dead, maybe there's still hope!" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader015" text="No, I will esacpe myself, goodluck!" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader016" text="Ok, I will escape with sally, and I will be back soon." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader017" text="(As soon as you decide, you saw Sally and some of the captives looking up at the hillside in the distance, the ground is shaking, Sally looked back at you and said: Something seems to be coming from over there!)" />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader018" text="My dear master, we, the sikan thank you for saving us. Without you we will surely face a gloom fate. We, the sikans, will be your servant forever." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader019" text="No, without those knights of sika, I'm sure no one can survive this day." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader020" text="Sure, but without you, we will never have a chance to be saved by the knights. I must say we will never forgot your deed and goodness." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader021" text="No, I don't want to enslave you forever, and you took an arrow because of me." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader022" text="No, I'm glade to get hurt if that means master can be safer. I'm an old man, I guess that can be my last bit of value. Now, master, you know who are the Slavers, and the sikans are counting on you." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader023" text="But how can I fight these Slavers? We are too weak." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader024" text="Don't worry master, I got a plan and we won't fail you. we must leave and find a suitable place to build a base for you. The sikans are the first race of the continet, there are still many factions in the continet will protect us. If we eastablish a base, those factions will surely offer their help, and the Slavers will think twice before launching attack. Now, we must hurry, this is not the place to talk. We can discuss it later." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader025" text="My dear master, I, Monnai, want to say 'thanks' to you in the name of the sikans, and we swear we will be your servant, forever." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader026" text="I still don't want you be my slave, I hope I can free you." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader027" text="Then so be it, I will be your new master, and you must stay loyal to me, forever." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader028" text="It's our honor to be your slave, some of us may choose to leave, but the rest will serve you till their very end. With the mark of slave on our flesh, we don't have any choice, we must be someone's slave unless someone can destory the slavers once and for all. And you are a good master." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader029" text="Yes, master, some of us may choose to leave, but the rest will serve you till their very end. " />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader030" text="Understood, now we have a base of operation, so what's next? how can we fight the slavers?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader031" text="Master, we don't have any chance to defeat the slavers if we don't expand our influence and power." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader032" text="So, what should I do?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader033" text="We, the sikan, are protected by numerous factions in the continent since the ancient times. If no one come to protect us this time, then… maybe fall is our unavoidable fate. For now, I suggest we should contact the knights of sika, they can protect us… for now." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader034" text="Where shall I go to find them? ah, yes, I have a letter from them. (you show Monnai the letter from the knights of sika.) " />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader035" text="A letter from the knights of sika? This will surely make things easier, you can find their messager in the nearby tavern. Just told them you are representing Sikans. We will continue the construction while you are searching The knights of sika. You can ask Sally to see what you can do if you want to help the construction work, master." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader036" text="Understood." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader037" text="My dear master, how can I help?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader038" text="Yes, tell me about that ritual, I mean, can you explain Navi's power?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader039" text="Yes, this is the power of the sikan oracles, through the right ritual, they can call on the power of the mother god." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader040" text="You mean that 'Ryenus'? the name Navi called on the ritual?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader041" text="Yes, master, but please don't call her name directly. This is our taoo. The mother god haven't respond to our ritual for a long time, this is truly a miracle, please, keep what just happened a secret. If others know it, I'm afraid other factions will do harm to us." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader042" text="Understand." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader043" text="The mother god have no malicious will to master, or she won't manifest her power. And thank you for helping Icey, looks like you truly improved her condition. She told me she want to thanky you, master, you can pay her a visit." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader044" text="Master, anything I can help?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader045" text="Nothing." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1001" text="Dear master, you are back. Patriarch Lorin has told me the current situation. With Xiang Chuba to protect the village, you can find other power to resist the slaver group with us." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1002" text="Well, I heard that Sika and Cagie have a long history? Can they protect the village?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1003" text="Master, please rest assured that the Cagie people, like us, may not have much shelter in the mainland except you my master. They will protect this village to the death. We have started training, and this time we will fight to protect our homeland." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1004" text="Well, I'm relieved that you said so. So did you know them very early?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1005" text="We have never seen them, but the Cagie have been in contact with us for a long time. In our historical records, it is said that there was once a generation of leaders of the Cagie nationality and our Sika nationality, who became very close friends. Since then, they have been one of the few forces on the mainland that have not been hostile to our Sika nationality." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1006" text="So what happened then?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1007" text="Later, our Sika nationality gradually declined and lost contact with the Cagie nationality. But unlike us, they always guarded their land until the emergence of the slaver group." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1008" text="Did the slaver group destroy them? What happened?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1009" text="It is said on the mainland that about 100 years ago, the king of the Cagie nationality married a slave, which caused the siege of the slaver group. Finally, the forces of the Cagie nationality were annihilated by the slaver group. Since then, few people on the mainland know about them." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1010" text="So Lorin, who are they?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1011" text="They are descendants of the remaining Cagie people who fled after the attack, because there are few remaining people, few people know, and there is no news on the mainland. Until about a few years ago, we got the news that the territory of the Cagie nationality was attacked by the slave group again. This time, it is said that only a few people survived." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1014" text="Thank you, I know." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1015" text="Thank you master for saving them, otherwise I'm afraid there will be no Cagie people on this continent. Please believe them, their hatred for the slaver group is only heavier than ours." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1101" text="Dear master, are you ready to go?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1102" text="Yes, I heard from Lorin that you have something else to tell me." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1103" text="Yes, Lorin should have told master that when traveling on the mainland, you must not disclose your identity, the gratitude and resentment with the slaver group, and everything about the Sika and Cagie nationalities." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian013" text="Let's make it simple, the sikan is the first race of the continent, They lived here for many centuries before any other races comes here.

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian050" text="That's all for now, he must left in a hurry, for a reason, he bring something important with him. I found the clue that will lead us to him." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1008" text="I'm confused. I heard that Sika Knights protect this continent, including Sikans." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1009" text="Yes, so they support you to establish a stronghold and guard the Sika clan. But it seems that things are not so simple, and they did not explicitly say that they would not help you, but it is obvious that they did not send anyone to come." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1010" text="I see, so what's the grudge between the Cagie and the Sika knight? And what grudges do they have with the slave group." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1011" text="The relationship between the Cagie and the Sika knights is hard to say, but I can assure you that the Sika Knights have absolutely no intention of hurting them, otherwise I will not agree to let them protect Lorin and his people. As for the grievances between the Cagie nationality and the slaver group, people on the mainland have spread, but the vast majority of people do not know the Cagie nationality. You can ask the head of Monnai. It is said that the relationship between the Sika nationality and the Cagie nationality has a long history." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1012" text="I see. I'll ask chief Monnai." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1101" text="Why should we camp here?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1102" text="It's not far from the forest here, and the stronghold of the Elin clan should be near here." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1103" text="So why don't we hurry?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1104" text="The settlement of the Elin clan does not welcome outsiders. If there is no correct way, we will just get lost in this forest." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1105" text="Didn't your teacher tell you how to find the Elin's settlement?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1106" text="Don't worry, since the teacher asked us to come here, she must know that we can find a way to get in." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1107" text="I don't know the meaning of your coming here so far. Except for Sika knight, these weak forces can't help you resist the slaver group at all." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1108" text="So you think I should give Lorin to you?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1109" text="To be honest, I don't know. Maybe your choice is right, but it is difficult to resist the slaver group by these weak forces. Besides, the ailing clan can't help you at all." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1110" text="Why?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1111" text="It is said that they declined in ancient times for some special reasons. Since then, they have been in this forest. Many people on the mainland have no idea of their existence." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1112" text="If so, why did your teacher let me come here?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1113" text="Well... I don't know, but I believe in teachers. There must be a reason why she asked you to come." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1114" text="... I really shouldn't come here." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1115" text="So why are you still here? I remember you are also one of Sika knight. If they refuse to help me, why don't you leave?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1116" text="Foreigner, I was indeed a member of Sika knight, but now I am not. We are wandering knights, just following the creed of Sika knights." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1117" text="Even so, you have no reason to continue to help me by my side." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1118" text="Maybe I'm just curious to see how far you can go. But don't worry, in the doctrine of Sika knight, we won't abandon our teammates. Now let's think about how to find a way to enter the Elin's Settlement." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1119" text="Look at that! Something is approaching." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1120" text="(there is a horse in the distance. It seems that a man fell on the back of the horse. The horse slowly approached you. Suddenly, the man on the horse fell down. Lotas hurriedly ran to pick her up. You took her into the camp and gave her some water. She recovered some strength and said to you...)" />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage028" text="Okey." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage029" text="{PLAYER.NAME}, I just reached a consensus with Monnai. If we want to fight the Slavers, then we need power and influence." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage038" text="First we must set up our own faction, then we shall make this settlement a stronghold, then we will talk about deal with the slavers." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage042" text="Elder Monnai, {PLAYER.NAME}, We need to speed up the construction of village and prepare for defense. We need to find help from anyone they can, but first we need someone to protect this settlement. There is a famous Rogue named Xiang Chu Ba nearby. He is the largest bandit band nearby. The most important thing is that unlike ordinary bandits, he only robs the the rich, and distributes the looted goods and money to those in need. Such behavior attracted many people to join him. If we can find a way to persuade him join our cause, it will be of great help to us. My people heard that now his band is resting near our village. If you want to persuade him, you must defeat him first." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage043" text="OK, I see. Let me deal with him." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage046" text="That's it. prepare yourself. He will come soon." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage047" text="Will he come?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage048" text="Don't worry, he will come as soon as possible. However, he has a large warband under his command. But I have got a plan for that, just follow my arrangement." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage049" text="Can I trust you? defeat a person with such a big warband is not a walk in the park." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage050" text="Well, I've already thought of it. Listen to my arrangement. I've set a trap for him. After the battle started, he won't take your life. After fighting for a while, you can escape." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage051" text="Retreat?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage052" text="Yes, but a fake one, you can lure to our ambush." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage053" text="Then?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage054" text="Remember when you retreat, head to the vally in the far side, we are outnumbered, so we must choose the best advantage point to set our ambush and traps." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage055" text="Understood." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage056" text="The rest is my part. Everything is under control. The bait has been thrown out, we just waiting for him to bite." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage059" text="I see. I don't want to die too young." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage060" text="Anything I can do for you?" />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1007" text="On the one hand, it is to see whether the Sika knight can provide help (he looks to the side of Derian, but Derian ignores him), on the other hand, we should go to other parts of the mainland to find forces that can help us resist the slaver group. There are many forces resisting the slave group in different places. Let's see if we can form an alliance with them to resist the slaver group." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1008" text="I'll go to see Deri (before you finish speaking, Derian snorted and interrupted you)" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1009" text="(Derian: hum, what forces can there be on this continent? In addition to the Sika knights who can really resist the slaver group, who else is interested in guarding the Sikans. You refuse to go to the Sika church and want to ask for their help.

I don't know the gratitude and resentment between the slaver group and the Sika family, but the gratitude and resentment between you and them must be known to everyone.)" />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1103" text="126 years ago, Lord. Yes, the only Cagie people left after we fled after the destruction of the kingdom. As for the reason, what the lord heard was not true. The queen of the Cagie clan was never a slave." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1104" text="Not a slave? You mean your king didn't marry a slave at that time? So why did the slaver group attack you." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1105" text="We don't know why, but it's clear in our records that the queen led the Cagie people to prosperity at that time. Everything was an excuse made by the slaver group to plunder us." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1106" text="I see. Why did the slaver group attack you again after so many years?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1107" text="I don't know why they attacked us again. If I knew, I would be ready for everything. Not like now." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1108" text="Who are you, including the Sika knight? Their goal seems to be you?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1109" text="I originally wanted to explain to you after the Lord solved the slaver group. I hope you can trust me and my people.

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1110" text="I think I can only trust you now. So Xiang Chuba is?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1111" text="After last attack, Xiang Chuba and a small number of Cagie people escaped from being captured by the slave group. The Lord can rest assured that we will defend here to the death." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1113" text="Monnai patriarch has discussed with me, and Monnai patriarch will try to contact Sika Knight them. Our plan is that the Lord will go to the major forces to find local forces willing to resist the slaver group together. This is a place where the Lord can go to visit the major forces. Please be careful, don't easily expose your identity and purpose. The claws and teeth of the slaver group are all over the continent. In addition, Monnai clan leader seems to have additional plans and Lord, you say." />
