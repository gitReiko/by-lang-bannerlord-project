             text="{=genoaFactionText}The Republic of Genoa was founded as a maritime city-state around the 11th century, it emerged as a powerful trading hub in the Mediterranean. Initially, Genoa's economy relied on agriculture, but its strategic location on the Ligurian coast enabled it to become a key player in Mediterranean trade, particularly in the transport of goods between Europe and the East. Genoa was governed by a system of oligarchy, with power concentrated in the hands of wealthy merchant families known as the noble republic. The city-state was ruled by a series of elected officials, including consuls and councils, who oversaw both domestic affairs and foreign policy.">
