  <string id="L4b5EWdD" text="The great Khan Urkhun conquered the eastern frontiers of the Empire and established the Khuzait khanate. Most remember him as a hero, though some resent how he curtailed the ancient liberties of his people to transform them from nomads into lords of a kingdom."/>

  <string id="richardCornwallDescription" text="Brother of current ruling King of England, Henry III, Richard was born at Winchester Castle, the second son of John, King of England. At the age of sixteen, he was given Cornwall by his brother King Henry III as a birthday present. Revenues from Cornwall helped make him one the wealthiest men in Europe. In 1257, he was elected as King of Germany by four of the seven Electoral Princes. His candidacy was opposed by Alfonso X of Castile. Pope Alexander IV and King Louis IX of France favoured Alfonso, but both were ultimately convinced by the powerful relatives of Richard's sister-in-law, Eleanor of Provence, to support Richard. Ottokar II of Bohemia, who at first voted for Richard but later elected Alfonso, eventually agreed to support the Earl of Cornwall, thus establishing the required simple majority. So Richard had to bribe only four of them, but this came at a huge cost of 28,000 marks. On 17 May 1257, he was crowned Richard King of the Romans."/>

  <string id="louisIXDescription" text="Louis was only twelve years of age when his father died and he was crowned king within the month at Reims Cathedral. His mother, Blanche, ruled France as regent during his minority, and then remained his valued adviser until her death. Today, he faces recurring conflicts with some of his realm's most powerful nobles, such as Hugh XII of Lusignan and Jean le Roux. During his reign, Louis IX has been reforming the French legal process, creating a royal justice system in which petitioners can appeal judgements directly to the king. His admirers regard him as the ideal Christian ruler. They say his skill as a knight and engaging manner with the public made him popular."/>
  <string id="henryIIIDescription" text="The current King of England is Henry III. Little is known of Henry's early life. He was named after his grandfather, Henry II. He assumed the throne after the death of his father when he was only nine in the middle of the First Baron's War; the civil war in which a group of rebellious barons waged war against King John. Henry believes that kings should rule England in a dignified manner, surrounded by ceremony and ecclesiastical ritual. He believes that his predecessors had allowed the status of the Crown to decline, and seeks to correct this during his reign."/>
