  <string id="5BWAsyeB" text="Fortune smiled on me. I was born to one of the richest houses in Europe. My father spent much money to educate me, so that I can retain that wealth. And the first and most important thing I learned is that the common people are the source of my wealth, so I must protect the common people."/>
  <string id="kRRnXYOR" text="Beyond that, I was taught what any aristocrat worthy of his noble name should know and how he should behave. Keep his word. Fight for his country. Have have the grace to listen to the needs of the poor men who work his estate. Have the sense not to take their advice on how to manage it."/>
  <string id="bFZrLY8W" text="My class was taught how to rule, and rule we should. But one of our number should always be above the others. Put us together in a Senate, as the Romans do, and we will always quarrel and fight. Let a king, an emperor or empress rule in the capital, and let their children succeed them, without any fuss. We shall give them a peaceful and prosperous countryside."/>
  <string id="SCogGc7N" text="Every man wishes to leave what he has to his children, be it a tiny patch of land or a throne. Everyone in Europe, rich or poor, grasps this. The universal principle of inheritance, not the obscure laws of the Romans and their senate, is what makes a ruler in the eyes of the people."/>
  <string id="kssR76dM" text="I will strive to be a good king. I'll do my best. But I know no matter how well, landlords will still cheat tenants, city guards will still demand bribes, warriors will still kill men to steal their cattle, drunken husbands will beat wives. The plague and the labor of childbirth will take more lives than all the evils of man put together. "/>
  <string id="FSwVVdHV" text="Still, men are willing to fight for me, though it gains them nothing, for no other reason that the throne is my right. I will not betray these men. If I win, in centuries to come, people will think back on my victory and think, 'the Lord smiles on those who fight for their rights.' That is all one can do."/>
  <string id="dlaodeKS" text="All men are thieves at heart. I'd rather have one big thief than a thousand little ones. So, I believe in monarchy."/>
  <string id="T1svPL9Z" text="I am the daughter of King Manfred. If I were his son, all his vassals would be tripping over their beards and walking sticks to swear allegiance to me. One day I will stand before them as queen, and they will give me their oaths."/>
  <string id="MoAKmXDv" text="We're of a very old family that has done great service to the Empire. But I'll tell you something - a man, whatever his bloodline, is only as good as his honor and his obediance to the law. "/>
  <string id="Cx2FCePF" text="The Church chooses the Emperor. That is our law. It has been twisted, broken, or ignored for 100 years. But it has never been changed. Without law, without fealty to the written word, there is but tyranny and the mob."/>
  <string id="uJeoa6u1" text="The Pope understands the law. If a man does not understand the law, no matter how much money he has, he cannot enter the Church. I respect our soldiers but they cannot govern. If I win this dispute, I will reestablish the Church's authority over the emperor."/>
  <string id="bpSh9rhh" text="Our ancestors have always upheld the law, upheld order, and made sure that the best people are the ones in charge. So that's what I'm doing now."/>
  <string id="2DpewE0u" text="The quality of blood will always show itself. Look at Alfonso and his scoundrels. Play to the mob. Who are his people? Nobodies. He's a jumped-up adventurer."/>
  <string id="3VSBVR8R" text="Anyway, Richard. He's from a good family, you can't deny that. He knows our laws and respects our laws, and you know he'll keep up standards."/>
  <string id="8faAcjLz" text="Echerion the Tyrant-Slayer was my ancestor. Wouldn't be right if I fought for an upstart demagogue like Garios or a half-foreign adventuress like Rhagaea, now would it?"/>
  <string id="jg6SMQLc" text="Our family has always sent its sons to become generals. It has been our privilege to lead the men of the Castile into battle. Without these men, there would be no kingdom. The great estates of the Church would be blackened ash."/>
  <string id="uK4IX036" text="The soldiers of Castile don't ask for much in return. They want a King who will train them hard, fight them hard, and reward them generously. Let them choose the man to do that."/>
  <string id="aRlW5rks" text="The Lord know I loved Frederick. I shed my blood for him. But his dream of peace with his neighbors was moonshine. You can have war on the frontiers or war at home. I prefer war on the frontiers. Let the men earn glory, gold, and tales to tell their grandchildren."/>
  <string id="9f11AsTw" text="My people are the people of the hills. Up here, we watch out for each other. Your life and wealth depend on your neighbors spotting an English raiding party coming your way. My people like king Alfonso. They trust him. I'm not going to spill their blood fighting for anyone else."/>
  <string id="6Opb3jr0" text="I am a rich man. I invest my money, and then I do whatever is necessary to make sure that money turns a profit. Does that answer your question?"/>
  <string id="OFOXDkPv" text="The Empire, before it was an empire, was a Republic. Emperors and their council made the decisions. My family were known for their talents as rhetors. We took it upon ourselves to speak well to fellow councillors, to steer them to reason. It is not easy to get a tumultuous crowd to think in its interests and not follow its passions, but we tried. "/>
  <string id="Cgdg9Q8t" text="The temptation to turn our affairs over to a tyrant, or a gathering of rich old men - it was overwhelming. Who wished to deal with the chaos, the stubbornness, of a crowd? It was never easy. But I still believe that the only just way for a community to make decisions is for all its members to vote."/>
  <string id="spQJxKtr" text="Richard will never restore the assemblies. Neither has any faith in the people. Alfonso, well, he is no democrat, but he has that faith. I will fight for him. Maybe he will bring back the assemblies. No one else will."/>
  <string id="He0b6FpY" text="The stormän swore an oath to my grandfather to obey him as jarl. They begged him to save them from the wrath of the Novgorods, which they had stirred up with their raids and their lawless ways."/>
  <string id="aifXT4E1" text="My grandfather did save the stormän, and ever since, their thankless heirs have tried to weasel out of that oath. They like to quarrel, and take what they want, and care nothing for the realm."/>
  <string id="nz6ff0nw" text="I will break them. By God I will bring them to heel, or the knife will fall on them."/>
  <string id="nQn87o0F" text="Our family have been the masters of this corner of the woods since the gods willed that the trees grow and the rivers flow. Someone wants to call himself King of Sweden? We have no quarrel with that. Just let that jarl know that on our land, we're still the masters."/>
  <string id="oUKWHMDq" text="Two generations ago, the Swedish magnates entered into a covenant to give their allegiance to a jarl. We surrendered our ancient freedoms so that we might be united in war. Was that wise? I have no idea. But I know that if we rupture that convenant now, forging it again would be long and bloody task. Perhaps an impossible one."/>
  <string id="91wurGIB" text="My family? We came from France, originally, can you believe it? A hundred years we have ruled England now, a hundred years with true rule of law. Now the French wish we never left, I'm sure. England would have been long in their grasp if not for us."/>
  <string id="7poObaCF" text="Yes, they needed a strong king, like a herd of cattle on a mountain trail needs a herdsman who knows the trail. Herds in the mountains, you see... Sometimes the stubborn old bulls, set in their ways, wander off the trail and lead the others toward a precipice."/>
  <string id="Sy7dajDq" text="The wise herdsman, you see, will slaughter the old bulls to prevent the destruction of the entire herd. And I am a wise herdsman."/>
  <string id="vzYQuR5r" text="We are the sons of our forefather Richard fitz Gilbert. He came to England with William the Conqueror himself, who gave him the lands surrounding Clare and we have held that earldom generations now. And I tell you, never have we seen a king like Henry. A right pious bastard, dare I say too pious? The man spends fortnights holding lavish ceremonies. But he holds us together, somehow, and I would stomach a great deal of tyranny for that."/>
  <string id="wv2jPN3Q" text="We the House of de Vere are proud earls of Oxford and we have served the kings faithfully for generations. Henry himself knighted me and has done me right by what my name is owed. But I am not blind. All I will say is I am not opposed to a reform of the royal government."/>
  <string id="PN8hNFek" text="The Banu Marin have never sought glory or domination. Where some see an enemy, we see only a trading partner who has gone astray. For that reason, we have tried to treat all others with fairness and respect."/>
  <string id="ZIhocjnr" text="For that reason, the tribes have always brought their quarrels to us, to adjudicate. And it was natural that, when it came time for the them to choose a sultan, that we were the ones chosen."/>
  <string id="GwvxfXs3" text="But it is wearisome to be Sultan. The tribes cling to their grievances as though they were their children. It is not in men's nature to appreciate the fruits of peace and order. Rather, they brood over small injustices and perceived slights, and dream of shedding blood."/>
  <string id="gpuxIEBl" text="We are the Banu Nimr. Our tribe is as old as is any of the Amazigh. But a hundred years ago we were driven into the desert. Only recently have we returned. The others look down on us for this."/>
  <string id="YWQlYXST" text="Abu Yahya is a wise man. He knows how to keep the peace, to soothe over tensions. But there is only so much he can do. We can overlook an insult, or two. But if we overlook too many, perhaps some people will think that we would also overlook an injury. That would be dangerous."/>
  <string id="uvd3DYcI" text="I would advise the other clans: Watch what you say about us. We have our pride, and our swords. Do not tempt us."/>
  <string id="eylmGUOE" text="The duty of a sultan is to lead the tribes in war, and to allow them to uphold their honor. It is not to make them love each other, and it is not to make men of honor sit down and pretend to be friends with thieves and scum in the name of 'peace.' That is all I will say."/>
  <string id="rKKAYQkJ" text="When my great-grandfather Louis the Younger departed on the Second Crusade, he did not expect to lose at Damascus. They say he slipped out of Antioch in secret, for his true goal was pilgrimage to the Holy City. If that is true, I admire his piety."/>
  <string id="yJQLtlXj" text="But piety alone does not a king make. Tell me, if you toss a handful of seeds into a pack of ravens, what does having that handful of seeds mean? It means that you get pecked a lot. I have spent most of my life in the saddle or sitting in front of a besieged castle. Once I thought, 'I suffer, but at least my son will rule a pious and peaceful kingdom.' Such lies we tell ourselves. There will never be peace."/>
  <string id="5mvtRbb8" text="My son will rule, and he will pray, and he will fight his brothers and vassals. And after him my grandchildren will fight each other. At least, as kings and princes, they can uphold the word of God, and I hope they live as Christ did. That is all the peace one gets in life."/>
  <string id="YZyaxSbH" text="Mieszko the First, my forefather, gave the Polish everything they had. They were as mangy swamp dogs, eating from the scrapheap outside the walls of the cities. He turned them into a pack of wolves. He raised his hand, and cities fell, and he gave the noblemen land to call their own."/>
  <string id="zR1ONwM8" text="Is there a duchy in Poland who does not like my decisions? Is there one who does not want me as High Duke? So be it - let him abandon his lands, the gift of my forefathers. Let him flee to the Baltics, or the Black sea for that matter. I will not hunt him."/>
  <string id="6roMVNMW" text="But he who stays here, in the land won by my forefather, he lives under my hand. That is all there is to say."/>
  <string id="dpYb59BB" text="We have suffered greatly in the invasions of the Mongols. So many of our men have fallen..."/>
  <string id="RyrdJI5j" text="It is for this reason that I lead our armies. The other houses, they think that the Tatars are savages, and that they are weak. They look at their land, their wealth, and think - we could take that. I can fight one Mongol, I can fight two, but I cannot fight them all."/>
  <string id="l4quU1x3" text="So long as Bolesław has a firm hand on things, I do not worry much. The other clans dare not covet our lands and herds too openly. Yes... A strong khan can be a great blessing to the weak, so long as he remains strong."/>
  <string id="yqn4Wtwr" text="We respect the duchy and we respect the banner of the High Duke. We swore our oaths to Bolesław and we shall keep faith with our oaths, so long as his heirs keep faith as well."/>
