  <string id="hx.wanderers.2.1" text="The Unfilial, its a title I earned for doing what needed to be done for my family."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.2.2" text="I left my home and joined the army as a horse archer, my pay sent home to support my family. The cost of filial piety."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.2.3" text="War ended, so did my income. Now Im just another veteran looking for a new way to make a living. And maybe a stiff drink to numb the memories."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.2.4" text="I can see how much your family means to you, your choice to support them shows your filial piety."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.2.5" text="I understand that you wanted to help your family, but I believe there are other ways to support them without putting yourself in danger and leaving them."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.2.6" text="Yeah, well see. Life never gives you what you want, only what you need."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.2.7" text="Im a horse archer, Looking for any kind of work that pays, its not like I have any choice or preference, I just need to survive."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.3.0" text="Yes of course."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.3.1" text="Recently, I was hired by a local lord to quell a rebellion in a neighboring province. The rebellion was led by a former general who had grown discontent with the lords rule. I lead my men into battle against the rebel forces. We were outnumbered, but I knew that we had the advantage in training and equipment."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.3.2" text="During the battle, I was faced with a moral choice. One of the rebel leaders, a former friend of mine, had been captured by my men. He begged for mercy, but I knew that if I showed him mercy, he would only return to fight against us again."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.3.3" text="I had to make a difficult decision, but in the end, I chose to uphold my duty to my lord and put him to death."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.3.4" text="I support your decision to put the rebel leader to death. He posed a threat to the stability of the province and it was necessary to eliminate him in order to ensure the safety of the people."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.3.5" text=" I am against your decision to put the rebel leader to death. He may have had valid reasons for his rebellion and killing him only perpetuates the cycle of violence. There may have been a chance for reconciliation and peace."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.3.6" text="After the battle, I returned to the lords castle, where I was rewarded for my service. I spent the night at the tavern, as it was a place where I could relax and celebrate with my men. And now Im here looking for new work."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.3.7" text=" I am looking for any work that requires my skills as a warrior and leader. I am not picky, as long as the pay is fair and the cause is just."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.4.0" text="Ah, well thats an interesting story."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.4.1" text="I was on the lookout for work, as Im in need of coin. I came across a village that was being terrorized by bandits. The villagers offered to pay me to take care of the problem."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.4.2" text="I agreed, and we set out to find the bandits hideout. But when we got there, we found that the bandits were actually just a group of desperate farmers who had turned to banditry to feed their families."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.4.3" text="It was a tough decision, but I chose to let them go and bring them back to the village to negotiate a fair deal with the villagers."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.4.4" text="I think it was a very noble decision to let the bandits go and try to find a peaceful solution for the villagers. It shows that you have a strong sense of justice and compassion."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.4.5" text="I think you made a mistake by letting the bandits go. They were criminals and needed to be dealt with accordingly. Your generosity has put the village in danger and your actions may have caused more harm than good."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.4.6" text="After that little adventure, I decided to take a break and have a pint or two at the local tavern. Im always on the lookout for new work, but Im not too picky. Ill take on just about anything as long as it pays well and doesnt involve hurting innocent people."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.4.7" text="I am looking for any work that requires my skills as a warrior and leader. I am not picky, as long as the pay is fair and the cause is just."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.5.0" text="Ah, yeah sure."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.5.1" text="I was once hired by a wealthy merchant to protect his caravan as it traveled through bandit-infested territory. During the journey, we were ambushed by a group of bandits."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.5.2" text="In the heat of battle, I let my berserker side take over and I went a bit crazy. In the end, we were victorious, but the bandit leader begged for mercy. I had a choice to make, kill him or spare him."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.5.3" text="I decided to spare him, but in the end, he ended up betraying us and leading the bandits to attack us again. We were able to defeat them once more, but it was a costly victory. I learned that sometimes mercy can be a weakness."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.5.4" text="I think your choice to spare the bandit leader was the right one. It shows that you have a sense of honor and compassion, even in the heat of battle."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.5.5" text=" I disagree with your decision to spare the bandit leader. It ultimately led to more harm and danger for you and the caravan. Its important to remember that in certain situations, mercy can be a liability."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.5.6" text="After the caravan job, I needed a place to rest and recuperate. I heard about this tavern and decided to check it out. I am currently resting here and looking for my next job opportunity."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.5.7" text="I am looking for work as a mercenary or bodyguard. I am skilled in battle and have a bit of a wild side, so I am well suited for those types of jobs."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.6.0" text="Why not"/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.6.1" text="Recently, I was hired by a wealthy merchant to escort a valuable cargo across treacherous terrain. Along the way, we were ambushed by bandits. I was faced with a difficult moral choice"/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.6.2" text="- to prioritize the safety of the merchant and the cargo, or to risk it all to save the lives of the innocent villagers who were also being attacked by the bandits. I made the decision to prioritize the safety of the merchant and the cargo, as that was my primary responsibility. "/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.6.3" text="However, I also made sure to eliminate the bandits as quickly and efficiently as possible to minimize the harm to the villagers. Ultimately, we were able to successfully deliver the cargo and the villagers were able to fend off the bandits."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.6.4" text="I think you made the right choice. The safety of the merchant and the cargo is important, and you were able to eliminate the bandits and minimize harm to the villagers."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.6.5" text="I disagree with your decision. The lives of innocent villagers should have been a priority, and the safety of the merchants goods should not have been more important."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.6.6" text="After completing the job, the merchant was pleased with my work and recommended me to others. I have been traveling and taking on various jobs, and I am currently resting in this tavern before moving on to my next job."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.6.7" text="I am a horse archer and a skilled scout. I am open to any work that pays well and allows me to put my skills to use. I am particularly interested in working for wealthy merchants or powerful lords as a bodyguard or mercenary."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.7.0" text="No problem"/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.7.1" text="One scenario that comes to mind was when I was leading a group of soldiers in battle. Our enemy had taken hostages, and they threatened to kill them if we did not retreat."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.7.2" text="I had to weigh the lives of the hostages against the success of our mission and the lives of my own soldiers. In the end, I made the decision to continue the attack, and unfortunately, the hostages were killed."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.7.3" text="It was a difficult and tragic choice, but it ultimately led to our victory."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.7.4" text="I think you made the right choice. The safety of the merchant and the cargo is important, and you were able to eliminate the bandits and minimize harm to the villagers."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.7.5" text="I disagree with your decision. The lives of innocent villagers should have been a priority, and the safety of the merchants goods should not have been more important."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.7.6" text="Afterwards, I retired to a tavern, feeling the weight of my decision, but also knowing that I had made the best choice for the success of my mission and for the safety of my soldiers."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.7.7" text="I am a berserker and a great commander. I am open to most any kind of work, as long as it is challenging and pays well. I have experience in battle, strategy, and leadership, so I am well-suited for roles such as a mercenary or a bodyguard."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.8.0" text="Well, let me tell you, I have many stories to share."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.8.1" text="One of the most recent and notable ones was when I was hired by a wealthy merchant to escort his daughter to a neighboring kingdom for an arranged marriage. Along the way, we were ambushed by bandits. I was able to fend them off, but the merchants daughter was gravely injured."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.8.2" text="I had to make a choice: I could either continue on our journey and deliver her to her intended husband, or I could stay with her and tend to her wounds. I chose to stay and heal her, and as a result, we missed the wedding."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.8.3" text="The merchant was furious and did not pay me for my services. But my honor and my duty as a healer were more important to me than any gold."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.8.4" text="I completely understand and support your decision to stay and heal the merchants daughter. Your sense of honor and duty as a healer is commendable."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.8.5" text="While I understand your reasoning, I think it was a mistake to stay and miss the wedding. The merchants financial loss and anger is a significant consequence."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.8.6" text="And now, I am here, looking for new opportunities and possibly, new adventures, especially if they include charming company such as yourself."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.8.7" text="I am a wanderer, seeking work as an archer, scout, and healer. What brings you to this tavern? Are you perhaps in need of someone like me, someone who can protect and defend you?"/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.9.0" text="I have many stories."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.9.1" text="I was on my way to a nearby town to inquire about potential job opportunities when I came across a group of bandits attacking a merchant caravan. "/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.9.2" text="I intervened and helped fend off the bandits, but not before they had caused significant damage. I couldnt just stand there and watch innocent people getting robbed and hurt. "/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.9.3" text="I stepped in and fought alongside the merchants. We were able to drive the bandits off and recover the stolen goods. "/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.9.4" text="I think it was a brave and honorable choice to intervene and help the merchants. Your actions showed true valor and generosity."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.9.5" text="I disagree with your decision to get involved in the bandits attack. It could have put you in unnecessary danger and could have potentially led to a worse outcome for all parties involved."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.9.6" text="The merchants were grateful and offered to buy me a meal and a room at the nearest tavern as a token of their appreciation. I accepted their offer and decided to stay for the night and continue my journey in the morning."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.9.7" text="I am a wanderer, looking for work. I am skilled in combat and comfortable with the shady and dark dealings. I am particularly interested in jobs that involve protecting caravans or escorting important figures. I also have experience in investigating and solving disputes. Im not afraid of going into dangerous situations as long as its for a good cause."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.10.0" text="The past a puzzle, and the future a riddle."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.10.1" text="I have been presented with many opportunities, but none as intriguing as the one I declined. I was offered a seat among the elite, but it was not meant to be mine. "/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.10.2" text="I have uncovered their hidden truths, and I have wielded them, but at a great cost. I had to disappear, to become a new person, but they still seek me out. But I am elusive, like the shadow in the night."/>
  <string id="hx.wanderers.10.3" text="Now, I wander, like a leaf in the wind, seeking new mysteries and new opportunities. The road ahead is long and winding, and the choices I make will shape my destiny."/>
