<!-- the Disgraced Knight -->  
    <string id="vs_prebackstory_disgraced_knight" text="Of course, with a pint it would be a pleasure to tell you my story !" />
    <string id="vs_backstory_a_disgraced_knight" text="I used to be a Vlandian knight and a member of the King's Order. I was part of Derthert's personal guard. I had glory, honors, wealth and land. However these things are linked to the powerful acknowledging your prowess. A very unreliable thing if it ever was one..." />
    <string id="vs_backstory_b_disgraced_knight" text="During a campaign as we set out to meet a rogue baron and his troops, we reached their settlement without crossing path with the rebels. To punish them Derthert ordered us to storm the defenseless village, pillage it and burn it to the ground. We were men of war, not common looters so several of my brothers and I rose up against this order. Our code of honor forbidding it." />
    <string id="vs_backstory_c_disgraced_knight" text="The act of defiance displeased the king who threatened to dismiss us from his guard, thereby forfeiting the benefits of our position and therefore thinking that this would bring us back into the line. The fairest among us did not give in however. It infuriated him even more and it led to our disgrace. My name was dragged through the mud, my wealth and land were confiscated, but my honor remained safe." />
    <string id="vs_response_1_disgraced_knight" text="From King's Knight to tavern anonymous, life can be a real kick in the balls !" />
    <string id="vs_response_2_disgraced_knight" text="You've made the right decision. If a man renounces his honor, what's left for him ?" />
    <string id="vs_backstory_d_disgraced_knight" text="Indeed, but honor alone isn't enough to feed a man, so I find myself obliged to sell my services to the highest bidder in a shabby tavern. Couldn't your troops use a veteran warrior ?" />
	
<!-- the Black Knight -->	
    <string id="vs_prebackstory_black_knight" text="I beg your pardon ? How is it possible that you don't know who I am ?" />
    <string id="vs_backstory_a_black_knight" text="You've probably heard of the Black Knight, winner of countless tournaments across the continent, terror to men and hero to ladies. Well, that's me!" />
    <string id="vs_backstory_b_black_knight" text="I could have been a King's Guard in the service of King Derthert, but the battlefields are sorely lacking in maidens to cheer me on, so I preferred the art of jousting. And let's face it, winning a tournament pays a lot more than a soldier's paycheck for a lot less risk." />
    <string id="vs_backstory_c_black_knight" text="Anyway, as long as I have enough money to buy wine, pay whores and time to seduce women while their husbands are at war, I'm the happiest of men !" />
    <string id="vs_response_1_black_knight" text="I understand better what a knight in shining armor is doing in a tavern like this, it helps to swagger with the ladies I guess." />
    <string id="vs_response_2_black_knight" text="What armor ! There's no doubt that tournaments pay off, but to win them, the man who wears it must have talent." />
    <string id="vs_backstory_d_black_knight" text="I'm not going to deny it, alas in these times of war tournaments are as rare as the dinars in my purse. You wouldn't be looking for a captain to inspire your men with his presence alone, would you ? My fame would reflect on you too of course." />
