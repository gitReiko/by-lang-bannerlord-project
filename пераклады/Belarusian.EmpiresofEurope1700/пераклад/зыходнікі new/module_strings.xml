  <string id="goldenhordedescription" text="In 1700, Lithuania was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a weakened and fragmented union between Poland and Lithuania. The Commonwealth was experiencing significant internal struggles, with a decentralized political structure that gave extensive power to the nobility and allowed for frequent political gridlock, particularly through the liberum veto, which allowed any member of the Sejm (parliament) to block legislation. Lithuania, while having its own Grand Duchy and institutions, was increasingly under Polish influence, especially after the 1569 Union of Lublin, which formalized the political union between Poland and Lithuania. The region also faced external pressures, particularly from the rising power of Russia, which sought to expand its influence in the region. The Great Northern War (1700–1721), which began in the same year, further destabilized Lithuania as Russian, Swedish, and Polish forces clashed over control of territories, with Lithuania caught in the conflict. Despite these challenges, Lithuanian culture, the Orthodox and Catholic churches, and the nobility remained central to the identity of the region during this period."/>

The Ottomans held sway over key Arab regions such as Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and the Arabian Peninsula, though their authority was often challenged by local rulers and tribal groups. The Arab lands were diverse, with a mix of Sunni and Shi'a Muslims, as well as Christian and Jewish minorities, and the region saw a variety of cultural and intellectual movements. In the Arabian Peninsula, the emergence of the Wahhabi movement in the early 18th century would mark the beginning of significant religious reformism. The Ottoman Empire was beginning to experience signs of decline, marked by internal corruption, administrative inefficiency, and external threats from European powers, especially the growing influence of Russia and Austria. Meanwhile, in North Africa, regions like Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya were under varying degrees of Ottoman or local dynastic control, with continued economic reliance on trade and agriculture. The Arab world in 1700 was a region caught between the stability of Ottoman imperial rule and the challenges posed by internal dissent and external rivalries."/>

During this period, many Berber tribes were integrated into powerful states such as the Ottoman Empire, which controlled large portions of North Africa, and the Kingdom of Morocco, which was a semi-autonomous monarchy under the Alaouite dynasty. The Berbers played a crucial role in these societies, both as rulers and as subjects, particularly in the military and trade. In Morocco, Berber tribes were influential in the governance of the kingdom, while in Algeria and Tunisia, Berber groups often resisted Ottoman rule, leading to intermittent uprisings. The Berber identity was shaped by their distinct languages, traditions, and often nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyles, which they maintained despite the political dominance of external empires. However, in 1700, their political and social influence varied greatly across the region, and the Berbers continued to navigate the complex interplay between local autonomy and the expanding power of neighboring empires."/>

Under the reign of King William III and Queen Mary II, and later Queen Anne, Britain was deeply involved in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), aligning with European allies to prevent the unification of the French and Spanish crowns under the Bourbons. Domestically, Britain was experiencing political shifts, with the Whigs and Tories vying for control, while the early stages of the Industrial Revolution began to take shape, promising significant economic change.

While France was initially successful in the war, it faced growing financial strain and a war-weary population. Domestically, the centralized power of the monarchy left little room for political or economic reform, and the heavy taxation needed to support France's military ambitions contributed to the burdens on the peasantry.

The empire was a patchwork of diverse ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups, with Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism being the major confessions.

By the late 17th century, the Ottomans were driven out of most Hungarian territories following the Great Turkish War (1683–1699) and the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), leaving Hungary largely under Habsburg rule. However, the imposition of Habsburg absolutism, heavy taxation, and efforts to suppress Hungarian autonomy fueled dissatisfaction among the population, especially the nobility.

The Protestant Ascendancy—a political, economic, and social system dominated by the Anglican elite—controlled Irish governance, marginalizing the Catholic majority and dissenting Protestant groups. The Penal Laws, introduced during this period, severely restricted the rights of Catholics, including land ownership, education, and political participation, aiming to suppress Catholic influence and consolidate Protestant power. Economically, Ireland remained agrarian, but landownership was increasingly concentrated in the hands of Protestant landlords, with many Irish Catholics reduced to tenant farming.

The central regions were dominated by the Papal States, under the authority of the Pope. In the south, the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily were Spanish-controlled territories, collectively known as the Spanish South. Culturally, Italy remained a hub of art, music, and intellectual activity, but politically it was a battleground for European powers, particularly during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), as Austria sought to replace Spain as the dominant foreign influence. The fragmentation and external control limited Italy’s political agency but preserved its regional diversity and cultural vibrancy."/>

However, by the late 17th and early 18th centuries, internal weaknesses, including court corruption, declining military strength, and tribal rebellions, undermined the empire’s stability. Shah Sultan Husayn, the reigning monarch in 1700, was seen as weak and ineffective, unable to address the growing threats to Safavid authority. Externally, the empire faced increasing pressure from the Ottoman Empire in the west and the rising power of tribal confederacies and Afghan insurgents in the east.

Its unique system of Golden Liberty gave the nobility extensive political rights but left the central government fragmented and ineffective, particularly due to the liberum veto, which allowed any noble to block legislative decisions in the Sejm (parliament). King Augustus II, who also ruled Saxony, sought to strengthen royal authority, but his ambitions embroiled the Commonwealth in the Great Northern War (1700–1721), as it became a battleground for larger powers like Sweden and Russia. Internally, the Commonwealth faced economic stagnation, social inequality, and tensions between ethnic and religious groups within its vast and diverse population.

Economically, the discovery of gold and diamonds in Brazil, its largest colony, provided a significant financial boost, reinforcing Portugal’s position in the transatlantic trade and fueling its monarchy. However, Portugal faced growing competition from other European powers, particularly England and the Dutch Republic, in trade and colonial ambitions.

Peter sought to modernize Russia through extensive military, administrative, and cultural reforms, inspired by Western European models. The year marked the beginning of the Great Northern War (1700–1721), as Peter allied with Denmark-Norway and Poland-Saxony to challenge Swedish dominance in the Baltic region, aiming to secure access to the sea and expand Russia's influence. Domestically, Peter initiated significant changes, including reorganizing the military, building a navy, and centralizing governance, though these efforts often faced resistance from traditionalist factions. The foundation for St. Petersburg, a symbol of Peter’s aspirations for a modernized and outward-looking Russia, was laid during this period.
