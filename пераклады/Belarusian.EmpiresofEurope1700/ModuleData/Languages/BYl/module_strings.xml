  <string id="goldenhordedescription" text="In 1700, Lithuania was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a weakened and fragmented union between Poland and Lithuania. The Commonwealth was experiencing significant internal struggles, with a decentralized political structure that gave extensive power to the nobility and allowed for frequent political gridlock, particularly through the liberum veto, which allowed any member of the Sejm (parliament) to block legislation. Lithuania, while having its own Grand Duchy and institutions, was increasingly under Polish influence, especially after the 1569 Union of Lublin, which formalized the political union between Poland and Lithuania. The region also faced external pressures, particularly from the rising power of Russia, which sought to expand its influence in the region. The Great Northern War (1700–1721), which began in the same year, further destabilized Lithuania as Russian, Swedish, and Polish forces clashed over control of territories, with Lithuania caught in the conflict. Despite these challenges, Lithuanian culture, the Orthodox and Catholic churches, and the nobility remained central to the identity of the region during this period."/>

  <string id="E11FA_desc" text="In 1700, the Arab world was a region of political and social fragmentation, with much of the territory controlled by the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled over vast parts of the Arab world since the 16th century. The Ottomans held sway over key Arab regions such as Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and the Arabian Peninsula, though their authority was often challenged by local rulers and tribal groups. The Arab lands were diverse, with a mix of Sunni and Shia Muslims, as well as Christian and Jewish minorities, and the region saw a variety of cultural and intellectual movements. In the Arabian Peninsula, the emergence of the Wahhabi movement in the early 18th century would mark the beginning of significant religious reformism. The Ottoman Empire was beginning to experience signs of decline, marked by internal corruption, administrative inefficiency, and external threats from European powers, especially the growing influence of Russia and Austria. Meanwhile, in North Africa, regions like Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya were under varying degrees of Ottoman or local dynastic control, with continued economic reliance on trade and agriculture. The Arab world in 1700 was a region caught between the stability of Ottoman imperial rule and the challenges posed by internal dissent and external rivalries."/>

During this period, many Berber tribes were integrated into powerful states such as the Ottoman Empire, which controlled large portions of North Africa, and the Kingdom of Morocco, which was a semi-autonomous monarchy under the Alaouite dynasty. The Berbers played a crucial role in these societies, both as rulers and as subjects, particularly in the military and trade. In Morocco, Berber tribes were influential in the governance of the kingdom, while in Algeria and Tunisia, Berber groups often resisted Ottoman rule, leading to intermittent uprisings. The Berber identity was shaped by their distinct languages, traditions, and often nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyles, which they maintained despite the political dominance of external empires. However, in 1700, their political and social influence varied greatly across the region, and the Berbers continued to navigate the complex interplay between local autonomy and the expanding power of neighboring empires."/>

However, Greek communities maintained their religious and cultural identity, with the Orthodox Church playing a central role in daily life and education. While many Greek elites worked within the Ottoman administration, most Greeks lived in rural areas, where life was often difficult. During this period, Greece was not a unified nation but consisted of various regions, such as the Peloponnese, the Aegean islands, and parts of mainland Greece, all controlled by local Ottoman pashas. Despite the hardships, Greece remained an important part of the Ottoman Empires economic network, especially in trade and agriculture.

The Kingdom of England had united with Scotland in 1707 through the Act of Union, forming the Kingdom of Great Britain. This new union was driven by political and economic motivations, particularly to strengthen the British Isles in the face of external threats, such as France and Spain, and to create a more unified market for British goods. Under the reign of King William III and Queen Mary II, and later Queen Anne, Britain was deeply involved in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), aligning with European allies to prevent the unification of the French and Spanish crowns under the Bourbons. Domestically, Britain was experiencing political shifts, with the Whigs and Tories vying for control, while the early stages of the Industrial Revolution began to take shape, promising significant economic change. This period also marked the height of British maritime power, as its navy became a dominant force in the Atlantic and beyond."/>

France was at the height of its military and cultural influence, with its army and navy among the most formidable in Europe. Louis XIVs lavish court at Versailles symbolized the strength of the monarchy, and France led in art, literature, and philosophy during the Age of Enlightenment. However, by 1700, France was embroiled in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), a conflict sparked by the death of the childless Spanish King Charles II and the potential union of the French and Spanish crowns under the Bourbon dynasty. While France was initially successful in the war, it faced growing financial strain and a war-weary population. Domestically, the centralized power of the monarchy left little room for political or economic reform, and the heavy taxation needed to support Frances military ambitions contributed to the burdens on the peasantry. Despite these challenges, France remained a key player in European geopolitics at the turn of the 18th century."/>

By the late 17th century, the Ottomans were driven out of most Hungarian territories following the Great Turkish War (1683–1699) and the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), leaving Hungary largely under Habsburg rule. However, the imposition of Habsburg absolutism, heavy taxation, and efforts to suppress Hungarian autonomy fueled dissatisfaction among the population, especially the nobility. This discontent laid the groundwork for future uprisings, including Rákóczis War of Independence (1703–1711).

The Protestant Ascendancy—a political, economic, and social system dominated by the Anglican elite—controlled Irish governance, marginalizing the Catholic majority and dissenting Protestant groups. The Penal Laws, introduced during this period, severely restricted the rights of Catholics, including land ownership, education, and political participation, aiming to suppress Catholic influence and consolidate Protestant power. Economically, Ireland remained agrarian, but landownership was increasingly concentrated in the hands of Protestant landlords, with many Irish Catholics reduced to tenant farming.

Sweden, under King Charles XII, was at the height of its influence as a leading military power in Europe, controlling vast territories around the Baltic Sea as part of the Swedish Empire. However, tensions with neighboring states culminated in the outbreak of the Great Northern War (1700–1721), in which Denmark-Norway, Russia, and Poland-Saxony allied to challenge Swedish dominance. Denmark-Norway, under King Frederick IV, was a dual monarchy that also controlled parts of northern Germany and sought to reclaim lost influence in the Baltic. The region was marked by intense competition for control of trade routes, territories, and regional hegemony, setting the stage for significant political and military upheavals during the early 18th century."/>

However, by the late 17th and early 18th centuries, internal weaknesses, including court corruption, declining military strength, and tribal rebellions, undermined the empires stability. Shah Sultan Husayn, the reigning monarch in 1700, was seen as weak and ineffective, unable to address the growing threats to Safavid authority. Externally, the empire faced increasing pressure from the Ottoman Empire in the west and the rising power of tribal confederacies and Afghan insurgents in the east. Despite its political struggles, the Safavid period remained renowned for its architectural and artistic achievements, which had a lasting impact on Persian culture and identity."/>

Its unique system of Golden Liberty gave the nobility extensive political rights but left the central government fragmented and ineffective, particularly due to the liberum veto, which allowed any noble to block legislative decisions in the Sejm (parliament). King Augustus II, who also ruled Saxony, sought to strengthen royal authority, but his ambitions embroiled the Commonwealth in the Great Northern War (1700–1721), as it became a battleground for larger powers like Sweden and Russia. Internally, the Commonwealth faced economic stagnation, social inequality, and tensions between ethnic and religious groups within its vast and diverse population. These factors weakened its ability to resist foreign influence, foreshadowing its eventual decline and partitions in the late 18th century."/>

However, Portugal faced growing competition from other European powers, particularly England and the Dutch Republic, in trade and colonial ambitions.
