  <string id="cs_desert_cult.name" text="Пустэльны Культ"/>
  <string id="cs_desert_cult.text" text="The Desert Cult, unique in Calradia, is a devout group of people formed around the idea that Calradia is doomed, and only worship of the Barren may bring survival in the harsh conditions about to arrive. They accept recruits from all over Calradia, either forcefully or through persuasion. In addition, they capture wanderers, often in the desert, and convert them to their cause through perhaps the most psychologically advanced methods of the age. They are led by Vlyna, a highly controversial man. Some call him a cheat, others a prophet; most history books refer to him as an epileptic, and some even a schizophrenic. Regardless, it is certain that he is a tactical genius, as the HQ of the Desert Cult has never been found. Of course, the desert cult uses his mystery and facts such as the HQ never being found as a talking point about God's favour shining upon them, thus bringing in even more recruits. Their forces can be seen sacking villages to gather loot for their cause, as well as burning down the places of worship of the infidels."/>
  <string id="cs_redemptive_order.name" text="Ордэн Збавеньне"/>
  <string id="cs_redemptive_order.text" text="The Redemptive Order is a religious organization inspired by a simple and yet elegant line of reasoning: 'If Calradia is in turmoil, and whatever the lords and the masses do make it worse, then we must be suffering under God's punishment and not a man-made conflict.' Though this was initially the exhortations of a few priests, knights all over Calradia started to take a liking to this idea. These knights then formed the Redemptive Order, which sought to punish all who 'obstructed God's grace shining upon' Calradia. The order captures those who it deems to be the disruptors of peace, and either retrains or executes them. Their methods and the intricacies of their organization are mostly unknown. The membership of the order seems to increase directly after kingdoms suffering heavy losses or economic hardship. Some say that this spike is due to the knights seeing with their own eyes the travesties of war; others say that this is due to the lords running out of money to pay the knights."/>
  <string id="cs_harbingers_of_wrath.name" text="Прадвесьнікі Лютасьці"/>
  <string id="cs_harbingers_of_wrath.text" text="The Harbingers of Wrath share similar roots to The Redemptive Order, but they seem to have reached opposite conclusions. They believe that God's days are limited, as evidenced by Him trying to destroy His creation before He is weakened enough for His creation to kill Him first. They claim to represent the wrathful age about to consume God, but for this age to come, they must first kill all who would rather take God's side."/>
  <string id="cs_manhunters.name" text="Паляўнічыя за Людзьмі"/>
  <string id="cs_manhunters.text" text="The Manhunters represent the efforts of the bourgeoisie and the aristocracy to put a hold on Calradia completely slipping from their hands. Each year, a fund is collected from every kingdom and every city in proportion to its wealth to fund the manhunters. It seems that the leading classes are aware that no matter how much infighting they may do, if anarchy takes hold, it will know no borders."/>
  <string id="cs_southern_enslavers.name" text="Паўднёвыя Занявольнікі"/>
  <string id="cs_southern_enslavers.text" text="The Southern Enslavers are an organized effort to capture the citizens of Vlandia, Battania, Sturgia, and the Northern Empire and sell them to the Enslavers' merchant protectors among the Aserai, the Western Empire, the Khuzait and the Southern Empire. They operate in fast skirmishes, though they also form some slave stacks when greed compels them to do so. Their elite soldiers are extremely cost-effective, as they are fast, deadly, and cautious."/>
  <string id="cs_northern_liberators.name" text="Паўночныя Вызвольнікі"/>
  <string id="cs_northern_liberators.text" text="The Northern Liberators are a response to the Southern Enslavers, though their activities parallel theirs. The practical difference between the two is that the Southern Enslavers are indiscriminate, whereas the Northern Liberators capture high-profile targets among the Southern supporters of the Enslavers. They then use these high-profile targets to either bargain or make some money themselves."/>
  <string id="cs_peasant_revolutionaries.name" text="Рэвалюцыянеры"/>
  <string id="cs_peasant_revolutionaries.text" text="A unique group among the peasant revolts - the Revolutionaries as they call themselves - want to reduce the powers of the aristocracy 'to ensure that they represent the interests of the people.' The exact method as to how this would be done is ambiguous among them, but they continuously discuss ideas ranging from a stronger senate to a parliamentary system. Historians have noted them to be an anomaly in Calradia, and most among these historians are certain that a person or group of people has spread these ideas among the revolters. Their exact intentions are, of course, unknown. These ideas pose a major predicament to the aristocracy."/>
  <string id="cs_peasant_absolutists.name" text="Ізгоі"/>
  <string id="cs_peasant_absolutists.text" text="The Outcasts are an extremely dangerous group of exiled tribespeople. This 'free folk' disregard any reign and view the lords as traitors to Nature, citing that the former is trying to take advantage of human turmoils and the latter as having allowed these 'destructive' laws to happen in the first place. To ensure freedom and a better world, they fight for a free choice of living. The group is especially popular among people who were exiled and lost their homes."/>
  <string id="cs_peasant_revolters.name" text="Валацужныя Разбойнікі"/>
  <string id="cs_peasant_revolters.text" text="The Roaming Brigands are composed of devious people who have taken arms against their lords either due to high taxation, recruitment, or insufficient protection. These scourges wander steppes, deserts and tundras and take to the ideas of absolulte anarchy and not rarily to destruction, as well."/>
  <string id="cs_barbarians.name" text="Барбары"/>
  <string id="cs_barbarians.text" text="Little is known about the Barbarians, except for the fact that they are barbarians and must be referred to suiting their lowly position. Every kingdom throughout Calradia has persecuted them for millennia, but their culture and settlements have always found a way to survive. Their tenacity is partially thanks to their semi-nomadic lifestyle and high adaptability, resulting in them outliving almost every one of their oppressors. Currently, Sturgia has them living under heavy taxation, tolerating them on the condition that they stay on the far northern lands, away from everyone else. However, rumour has it now that the Calradian kingdoms are weakened, they might stand a chance, and in support of the rumours, barbarian troops and peoples have started to be sighted through especially Northern Calradia."/>
  <string id="cs_ko_phoenix.name" text="Ордэн Феніксы"/>
  <string id="cs_ko_phoenix.text" text="Вландыйцы - апошняе каралеўства, дзе захаваўся стабільны рыцарскі ордэн. Гэта нядзіўна, бо гістарычна Ордэн Фенікса быў самым дысцыплінаваным у Кальрадыі."/>

  <string id="cs_humar.name" text="Хумар"/>
  <string id="cs_humar.text" text="У кланах Хумару, як і па ўсёй Кальрадыі, часта здараюцца міжусобіцы. Праўда, часам знаходзяцца моцныя мужчыны ці жанчыны, якія прыходзяць да ўлады і яднаюць кланы пад адным сьцягам. Бо іхні народ не выпрабоўвае анічога, апроч сталага суперніцтва і войнаў, яны знайшлі шляхі аптымізаваць і палепшыць сваю зброю, не кажучы ўжо пра выкарыстаньне чорнага пораху!"/>
  <string id="cs_madmen.name" text="Шаленцы"/>
  <string id="cs_madmen.text" text="Шаленцы пакутавалі і прымушалі пакутаваць другіх на працягу стагодзьдзяў, ды й Кальрадыйскія шаленцы нічым не адрозьніваюцца ад іншых. Хаця гэтыя ізгоі грамадства вельмі непрадказальныя, іх рыхтоўля можа стварыць лепшых ваяроў, якімі можа ганарыцца Кальрадыя. Бо з пэўнай практыцай некаторыя шаленцы не адчуваюць жаху, а іншыя кажуць, што нават болю."/>
