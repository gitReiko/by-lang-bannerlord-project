  <string id="kingdom.nordlings.text" text="Hailing from the deeper northlands the Nordlings are true masters of cold weather fighting and raiding. For a time the Nords had aided the Sturgians in the efforts to claim lands and plunder. However they have now grown tired of their allies mewling efforts. Raganvad, being a descendant of Nord stock was promised to be made a full King of these lands with their aid and now seeks to weed out the weak Sturgian Princes and drive into other lands for more conquest."/>

  <string id="kingdom.vagir.text" text="The Vagir are a mix of Sturgian northerns and disgruntled Battanians. This cross of cultures has made them strong and hardy, able to overcome thick snowfall and dense forests with ease. For now their neighbours seem intent on fighting one another and this, they hope, will give them time to fortify and make ready for when war comes to their newly founded Kingdom."/>

  <string id="kingdom.royalist_vlandia.text" text="Vlandia expanded into the western and then northern Empire, taking lands and gaining wealth, however, with this expansion they overstretched allowing the Paleicians to rise up and claim most of the conquered lands from the western and northern Empire. This turn of events caused old grievances between the lords of land to inflame and soon enough rebellion was in the air. Derthert awarded lands to those who were most loyal to him and who had fought the hardest to claim the new areas. However, without the support of the northern lords with their supplies and troops these lands were lost to uprisings by the long suppressed indigenous Paleicians. With the loss of their best cavalry and archers in the uprisings basic troops were required to now fight their civil war, thus the crossbow became the main weapon of choice for the Vlandians due to the little training required to fire the weapon. Solid spear infantry were also raised to counter the separatist cavalry."/>

With the success of the Vlandian wars against the Western and Northern empires the Paleicians saw their chance to rise up and take their lands back once again. With the Vlandians involved in a civil war and the Empires constant infighting the Paleic people banded together to overthrew the weakened Vlandians, claiming castles and towns while the most influential Paleicians declared themselves the new lords of the land."/>
