				text="Да вайны Онін сыход вучня аблогавай справы да іншага майстра азначаў вельмі балючую сьмерць у выпадку яго вяртаньня да майстра праз паланеньне. Але часы зьмяніліся. Найбагацейшыя замкі Японіі палі, зараз іх муры сталі вышэй, чым некалі. Валадары Сайкаяў плацяць меней аблогавым майстрам, і гэты заробак часта затрымваецца. Таму я гатовы узяцца за новую працу, калі яе прапануюць." />
		<string id="SkUwSwLZ"
				text="Мой бацька быў адным з тых, каго Асікага Ёсітэру навучаў у палонных інжынераў. У тыя часы нашы людзі мала ведалі пра аблогавую справу. Яму не дазвалялі працаваць ні на кога, апроч Сёгуна Асікага, іначай яго б забілі самай непрыемнай чынам. Але ён навучыў мяне, свайго сына, сваім ведам, і ў цяперашнім пакаленьні да гэтага сталі ставіцца спагадней. Таму я магу працаваць на каго захачу." />
		<string id="RYWoN1qp"
				text="Ведаеце, льга падумаць, што тут падаюць сапраўднае сакэ, а не гэтую мачу... Прабачце, на чым мы спыніліся? Ах так, мая гісторыя." />
		<string id="QEO5Wo1m"
				text="Я шмат гадоў езьдзіў за Рудзодзі Таканобу. Я меў добрую рэпутацыя і прыстойныя грошы. У суседняй вёсцы жыла дзяўчына, ціхая, але з добрымі сьцёгнамі, здольнымі да нараджэння, якая, як я думаў, стане добрай нявестай." />
		<string id="X9IcvNnc"
				text="Я пайшоў да яе брата і прапанаваў яму 20 коней – добрая цана. Але ён сказаў, што не аддасьць сваю сястру 'за такога чалавека, як я'. Я спытаў яго, што ён мае на ўвазе, але ён не адказаў, і я даў яму як сьлед. Можа, пару ўдараў – ня больш. Сапраўднаму мужчыну гэта не павінна было нашкодзіць, але гэты шчанюк памёр у мяне на руках." />
		<string id="F1hLRHDo"
				text="Я гадамі езьдзіў пад сцягам Рудзодзі Таканобу. Мне варта было б заняць ганаровае месца пры яго палацы. Але я забіў чалавека з багацейшага клана за абразу, а той меў зашмат сваякоў, каб я мог далей затрымлівацца." />
		<string id="LWjvkvyj"
				text="Я родам з аднаго горнага клану, што жыве на крайняй поўначы. Ня ведаю, ці знаёмыя вы зь іх звычаямі. Паспрабую вытлумачыць." />
		<string id="HbBVafZh"
				text="Так... Я раскажу вам гісторыю пра жыцьцё ў вялікай Тумедзкай ардзе, што наводзіць жах на ўвесь сьвет." />
		<string id="hjmaZSrv"
				text="Я біўся за Алтан Хана. Але пешшу - мая сям'я з горада, а не стэпу. Жыцьцё трошкі іншае для нас." />
		<string id="fKuxXywF"
				text="I'm a soldier by trade. I've served in the Amago's army for 20 years. Once upon a time they were worthy of respect. I served them for years, but war was not kind to them." />
		<string id="os4ZW2gc"
				text="But Amago Yoshihisa led the army into a failed siege defense at Gassantoda Castle. You may have heard that story. I was laid up sick at the time. But a lot of my comrades didn't come back, and things were never the same afterward." />
		<string id="08t1XV2r"
				text="After the siege, The Amago were forced to a small island in northern Sanyo, with no hope of reconquering their lands." />
		<string id="WvwT5D2l"
				text="I was a solider in the Amago army. How we came to this sorry state is a sad tale that you've no doubt heard already from my comrades. But I'm sure you're familiar with our mettle in battle, and our skill at turning youths into soldiers." />
		<string id="BDTsEQKa"
				text="Then I joined the Sakai, mercenaries. They spent most of their time using guns. Ha! Me, I'd wade into the midst of the enemy, dealing out death right and left - and, well, all they had to say afterward was 'Why didn't you keep ranks?'" />
		<string id="PJY8IeMD"
				text="Started in the Ashigaru. I found that I was the only real warrior among them. They were all about marching here and there in their pretty uniforms, not pulling sword from scabbard for months on end. I told them what I thought, and my captain told me to keep my mouth shut or leave. So I left." />
		<string id="8oc7bO2s"
				text="Has no one told you that leaving a gap in a formation is as good as treason?" />
		<string id="1jWhdMiM"
				text="Let me tell you friend, I'm hard. I've fought as an ashigaru, then with the Sakai, any mercenaries worth their salt, I've been with them. Others may tell you've they've done what I've done, but I'm the real thing." />
		<string id="XY76uN2m"
				text="Bandits took me when I was a girl. I learned to fight with them as I grew, and did quite well with them." />
		<string id="NIy8l5HF"
				text="Perhaps it was my destiny to become like this, a warrior with who enjoys slaughtering. Most men can't handle my presence." />
		<string id="NDFxrOZq"
				text="I feel no guilt, no remorse. I kill when it is necessary, and don't ask questions." />
		<string id="rlHt9ZWE"
				text="Interesting." />
		<string id="lNjP8zRn"
				text="You seem somewhat unhealthy." />
		<string id="BYKVqoyU"
				text="There's not much more to say. I'm good at what I do, and i'll follow orders. So here I am, looking to make a living through the only means I know - shedding other people's blood. Got work?" />
		<string id="HSjsEM2c"
				text="I was raised by bandits where I learned to fight. I enjoy killing and wish to do it as much as possible." />
		<string id="buxRNQSQ"
				text="Because I loved my mother, and because I was faster and stronger than the boys, I did all that she said I would do. Of those born in my year, I was the first to kill an enemy. My mother boasted even more, so that the other women came to hate her. They turned us all out of our encampment. We were forced to sell our lands, as we could not take them with us, and we were given but a fraction of the price. All we had was our horses. Of course raiders found us soon enough, and killed my mother, and took our horses. I escaped." />
		<string id="YjjgGEG5"
				text="I wandered a bit around Japan. I starved a bit. But I followed the raiders and one, when he went beyond the campfire to empty his bladder, did not return. I now have his purse and his sword." />
		<string id="wFRMSMQD"
				text="Every day, I give thanks to the Heavens that I was not born to that life." />
		<string id="Iy7eNC0Q"
				text="I was the brat of a caravan guard. Never knew my mother, but my Da kept me close. I grew up running between the legs of horses on the roads, eavesdropping on merchant gossip in the cities, eating mochi cakes bought me by the other guards. A happier childhood you couldn't imagine." />
		<string id="toWs4s58"
				text="So here I am. Guess I'm not so interested in the marriage part, but I like the denars and I like my freedom. Maybe some day I'll surprise my Da with a nice farm to keep him happy in his old age." />
		<string id="NaLmWKEQ"
				text="I was the child of a caravan guard. I spent my babyhood swinging from a sling on the side of a horse, and my childhood chasing strays. But caravans are preyed upon by bandits and others, and I decided I don't like being prey. I reckon I have the skills to be a predator." />
		<string id="qKFHM8ZG"
				text="I'm a surgeon. I trained at the imperial academy in Kyoto. I had many rich and influential patients in the town. I thought I was well shielded from the intrigues and dangers of the imperial Court." />
		<string id="kubhuuoa"
				text="But one day I was contacted by an agent of the Emperor. I do not know how well you know them. At first they wanted small harmless details about my patients. To do so was a violation of my oath, but I was anxious to have the favor of the Emperor. But soon they began to call on me for more and more." />
		<string id="qx2IjYqq"
				text="There was a woman who lived out on the street. Refugee from the wars. Had a small child, a baby really. It was all she had. She'd make small cakes of rice over a fire. Then one day a young man from the palace came down the street in his horse. Wasn't looking where he was going, didn't care, and his horse crushed that baby's head." />
		<string id="NDFxrOZq"
				text="I feel no guilt, no remorse. I kill when it is necessary, and don't ask questions." />
