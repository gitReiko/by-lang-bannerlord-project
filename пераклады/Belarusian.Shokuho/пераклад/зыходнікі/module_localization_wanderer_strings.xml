				text="Now, before the Onin war, if a man apprenticed in siegecraft went to work for another master, it meant a very painful death if he was recaptured. But times have changed. The richest of Japans castles have fallen, and they build their walls higher than they once did. The saikai lords pay less for a siegemaster, and that pay is often late. So I am up to taking other employment, if it is offered." />
		<string id="SkUwSwLZ"
				text="My father was one of the men that Ashikaga Yoshiteru had trained by captured engineers. Our people knew little of siegecraft in those days. Well, he was not allowed to work for anyone but the Ashikaga Shogun, or he would be killed in a very unpleasant way. But he taught me, his son, what he knew, and in this generation things are a little more lenient. So I can work for whom I please." />
		<string id="RYWoN1qp"
				text="You know, youd think this place could serve proper sake, instead of this piss... Sorry, where were we? Ah yes, my story." />
		<string id="QEO5Wo1m"
				text="I rode for years behind Ryūzōji Takanobu. I had good name and a good sum of money. There was a girl in a neighboring village, quiet thing but good childbearing hips, who I thought would make a good bride." />
		<string id="X9IcvNnc"
				text="So I went to her brother, and offered him 20 horses - a good price. But he said he wasnt giving his sister to a man like me. Asked him what he meant by that, and he didnt answer, so I gave him a good punch. Maybe a couple punches - no more. Shouldnt have hurt a real man, but this little whelp died on me." />
		<string id="F1hLRHDo"
				text="I rode behind the banner of the Ryūzōji Takanobu for years. I should have had a place of honor in his court. But I killed a man from a richer clan over an insult, and he had too many kinfolk for me to linger anymore." />
		<string id="LWjvkvyj"
				text="I am from one of the highland clans, in the far north. I do not know if you are familiar with their ways. I will try to explain." />
		<string id="HbBVafZh"
				text="Yeah... Ill tell you a tale of life in the great Tumed hordes, terror of the world." />
		<string id="hjmaZSrv"
				text="I fought for Altan Khan. But I fight on foot - my familys from the town, not the steppe. Lifes a little different for us." />
		<string id="fKuxXywF"
				text="Im a soldier by trade. Ive served in the Amagos army for 20 years. Once upon a time they were worthy of respect. I served them for years, but war was not kind to them." />
		<string id="os4ZW2gc"
				text="But Amago Yoshihisa led the army into a failed siege defense at Gassantoda Castle. You may have heard that story. I was laid up sick at the time. But a lot of my comrades didnt come back, and things were never the same afterward." />
		<string id="08t1XV2r"
				text="After the siege, The Amago were forced to a small island in northern Sanyo, with no hope of reconquering their lands." />
		<string id="WvwT5D2l"
				text="I was a solider in the Amago army. How we came to this sorry state is a sad tale that youve no doubt heard already from my comrades. But Im sure youre familiar with our mettle in battle, and our skill at turning youths into soldiers." />
		<string id="BDTsEQKa"
				text="Then I joined the Sakai, mercenaries. They spent most of their time using guns. Ha! Me, Id wade into the midst of the enemy, dealing out death right and left - and, well, all they had to say afterward was Why didnt you keep ranks?" />
		<string id="PJY8IeMD"
				text="Started in the Ashigaru. I found that I was the only real warrior among them. They were all about marching here and there in their pretty uniforms, not pulling sword from scabbard for months on end. I told them what I thought, and my captain told me to keep my mouth shut or leave. So I left." />
		<string id="8oc7bO2s"
				text="Has no one told you that leaving a gap in a formation is as good as treason?" />
		<string id="1jWhdMiM"
				text="Let me tell you friend, Im hard. Ive fought as an ashigaru, then with the Sakai, any mercenaries worth their salt, Ive been with them. Others may tell youve theyve done what Ive done, but Im the real thing." />
		<string id="XY76uN2m"
				text="Bandits took me when I was a girl. I learned to fight with them as I grew, and did quite well with them." />

		<string id="rlHt9ZWE"
				text="Interesting." />
		<string id="lNjP8zRn"
				text="You seem somewhat unhealthy." />
		<string id="BYKVqoyU"
				text="Theres not much more to say. Im good at what I do, and ill follow orders. So here I am, looking to make a living through the only means I know - shedding other peoples blood. Got work?" />
		<string id="HSjsEM2c"
				text="I was raised by bandits where I learned to fight. I enjoy killing and wish to do it as much as possible." />
		<string id="buxRNQSQ"
				text="Because I loved my mother, and because I was faster and stronger than the boys, I did all that she said I would do. Of those born in my year, I was the first to kill an enemy. My mother boasted even more, so that the other women came to hate her. They turned us all out of our encampment. We were forced to sell our lands, as we could not take them with us, and we were given but a fraction of the price. All we had was our horses. Of course raiders found us soon enough, and killed my mother, and took our horses. I escaped." />
		<string id="YjjgGEG5"

				text="Every day, I give thanks to the Heavens that I was not born to that life." />
		<string id="Iy7eNC0Q"
				text="I was the brat of a caravan guard. Never knew my mother, but my Da kept me close. I grew up running between the legs of horses on the roads, eavesdropping on merchant gossip in the cities, eating mochi cakes bought me by the other guards. A happier childhood you couldnt imagine." />
		<string id="toWs4s58"
				text="So here I am. Guess Im not so interested in the marriage part, but I like the denars and I like my freedom. Maybe some day Ill surprise my Da with a nice farm to keep him happy in his old age." />
		<string id="NaLmWKEQ"
				text="I was the child of a caravan guard. I spent my babyhood swinging from a sling on the side of a horse, and my childhood chasing strays. But caravans are preyed upon by bandits and others, and I decided I dont like being prey. I reckon I have the skills to be a predator." />
		<string id="qKFHM8ZG"
				text="Im a surgeon. I trained at the imperial academy in Kyoto. I had many rich and influential patients in the town. I thought I was well shielded from the intrigues and dangers of the imperial Court." />
		<string id="kubhuuoa"
				text="But one day I was contacted by an agent of the Emperor. I do not know how well you know them. At first they wanted small harmless details about my patients. To do so was a violation of my oath, but I was anxious to have the favor of the Emperor. But soon they began to call on me for more and more." />
		<string id="qx2IjYqq"
				text="There was a woman who lived out on the street. Refugee from the wars. Had a small child, a baby really. It was all she had. Shed make small cakes of rice over a fire.
