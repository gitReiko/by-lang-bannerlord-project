1568 год. Ода Набунага рушыць на Кіёта…

The Ashikaga Shogunate is weak. The Daimyos of Japan ignore the authority of the Shogun, and fight to claim power and influence for themselves. The Sengoku Jidai has turned the lands into fields of blood. In this destructive time, there is opportunity for those who are willing to seize it. Will you fight to make a name for yourself, or fall before the might of others?

Shokuho is a complete overhaul mod set in feudal Japan. Every aspect of the game has been redone to accurately depict the setting of feudal Japan. Shokuho models the settlements, lords, clans, and kingdoms of the time with historical accuracy. With the size of the map over 5 times as big as vanilla and with 56 towns and 181 castles, it is one of the biggest overhauls of Bannerlord to date.

Core features

- Sieges in Shokuho feature a tiered system, forcing attackers through several deadly checkpoints, mimicking the real castles of the time. Assaulting a castle in Shokuho requires overwhelming troops. Starving the defenders may be a better solution.
- Engage armies on the sea with naval battles. Control ships by issuing orders, or steering them yourself. Board enemy ships and fight them hand to hand, or destroy them from afar with archers and gunners. 
- The aftermath of a battle is a painful site, but a lucrative one for those willing to get their hands dirty. Enter the scene of a post battle and loot what you can from the bodies. Fight off other looters looking for an easy score. Get out with as much as you can. The longer you stay, the longer you risk getting overwhelmed.
- Enlist in a lords army as an ordinary troop. Through battle, earn promotions and new equipment. Perform tasks with your lord, earning yourself favor. Prove yourself enough, and you may catch the eye of the Daimyo themself. 
- Shokuho comes with the well-known Diplomacy mod integrated by default. It features alliances, war exhaustion, messengers, and more! You can find it here. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2881380744
- Promote troops in your party that perform exceptionally to companions. Ask them about your army and they will give unique insight about your current situation, offering advice.
- Read books found in temples to improve your skills, gaining XP and sometimes focus points.
- Fight duels in unique locations across the map against skilled opponents, earning renown and proving your prowess.
- Many many more!
