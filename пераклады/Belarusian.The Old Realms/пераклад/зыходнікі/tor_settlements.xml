Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old World. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short.
