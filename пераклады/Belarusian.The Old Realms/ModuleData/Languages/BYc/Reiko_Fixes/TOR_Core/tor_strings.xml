  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String1" text="You have the look of someone who's never seen a spec of black powder nor grease. Are you in the right place?"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String2" text="Ah, you have returned. What news do you bring?"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String3" text="Come back to me when you have news."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String4" text="Did you find {ROGUE_ENGINEER_NAME}?"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String5" text="You again, what do you want?"/>

  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String9" text="How can I buy more cannons?"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String10" text="Nothing at the moment, I must leave."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String11" text="I have reconsidered your offer, I would like to help."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String12" text="Greetings Master Engineer, I am {PlAYERNAME}. I have come seeking access to the Forges of Nuln. Can you help?"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String13" text="I am, I have come seeking access to black powder weapons."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String14" text="Hah!, you don’t look like you would even know what to do with them. What could you possibly need with our crafts?"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String15" text="I am far too busy for this, leave my sight."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String16" text="These are the mightiest weapons of the Empire, they hold back the tide of darkness time and again. We do not hand out our crafts to any who waltz in, I do not know you. Nor have you earned our trust."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String17" text="We may however be able to come to an agreement, there is an internal matter that needs urgent attention and I am unable to act. If you help, as a personal favour, I will see what I can do for you. What say you?"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String18" text="What would you have me do?"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String19" text="I don't have time for this."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String20" text="Usually we don’t resort to outside assistance but we are short handed, we have had some important components stolen from the Forges of Nuln and they must be returned. Immediately. If you can track down these runaways and find these parts then we can talk further."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String21" text="I can, as long as our bargain remains the same. I will find him for you, and in return, you will allow me access to the Forges of Nuln."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String22" text="If this is the only way you will allow me access to the forges, then so be it. I will bring you his head."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String23" text="I’m afraid not, I have other tasks to attend to."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String24" text="We have an agreement then, I believe I may know his whereabouts. I will mark it on your map for you, may Sigmar guide you stranger."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String25" text="I understand, I will return the moment I have news."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String26" text="That is all it will take? Sounds easy enough."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String27" text="I do not have time for this."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String28" text="Good, I expect positive results and your hasty return."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String29" text="A shame, think on it and return if you change your mind."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String30" text="I am afraid I have failed to bring what you ask."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String31" text="Tsk, I expected better. There may still be time, you can still track them if you are swift"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String32" text="I won't let you down a second time."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String33" text="I don't think I can do it at this time."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String34" text="I have returned but without the stolen components, I am afraid to say they are still missing."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String35" text="I see, this is not what I had hoped for. Were there any further clues, did you interrogate these scoundrels?"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String36" text="One of the bandits did mention a name, {ROGUE_ENGINEER_NAME} I think?"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String37" text="Blast! I should have known. If you are willing, I would ask for your assistance once more. This matter may be more dire than I originally imagined. {ROGUE_ENGINEER_NAME} is an Engineer, a good one at that, but his works always seemed...wrong."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String38" text="If he has stolen these parts, it can only be for something heinous. I must ask that you track him down, and put an end to whatever madness he is trying to concoct. Will you do this?"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String39" text="I have yet to track down the runaways."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String40" text="I see, return to me when you have something useful."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String41" text="{ROGUE_ENGINEER_NAME} will no longer be a problem and I have retrieved what he stole from you. I’m unsure what he was trying to do with them."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String42" text="It matters not, it would have been something warped no doubt. I must thank you for your efforts, and your discretion. As agreed upon, you may now access our foundries and purchase from us as you please."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String43" text="Now, how can I help?"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String44" text="I have yet to track him down"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String45" text="I see, return to me when you have better news."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String46" text="Of course, you'll find only the best from the Forges of Nuln!"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String47" text="What else can I do for you?"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String48" text="A pair of our novice engineers are eagier to join you for the right price ({RECRUITMENT_PRICE})."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String49" text="Welcome on board."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String50" text="I don't have the funds for them right now."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String51" text="On a second thought, maybe later."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String52" text="To buy cannons you must be in the service of an Imperial Elector Count"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String53" text="The amount of cannons you can field in your army increases every 50 levels in Engineering skill."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String54" text="If you have met these requirements, simply speak to me and I'll show you what we have."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String55" text="Cannons are placed using the spellcasting Mode, but to fire the cannons you will need to hire at least two Cannon Crew"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String56" text="You will also need to ensure that the cannon is in your party inventory"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String57" text="Engineers and Cannon Crew can both fire cannons."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String58" text="{ROGUE_ENGINEER_NAME} was right, they sent someone after us! Grab your weapons quickly!"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String59" text="Woah hold there, I have merely come for the stolen parts, there is no need to shed blood here. Perhaps an arrangement can be made?"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String60" text="Lay down your weapons and I may spare your lives."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String61" text="Weapons or no, we will slay you all and take back what you stole!"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String62" text="You will not trick us!  They will serve a greater purpose! You will not take them!"/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String63" text="So the old fool sent you to find me? How did he figure me out? It matters not, you will stand in the way of my creations. You will die here!"/>

  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String69" text="The Vampire Counts are fiends without equal. They seek to topple the civilisations of the living and supplant them with an Undead empire. Each Vampire is a unique and majestic figure with his own personality, drive and ambition. In contrast, their minions are mindlessly obedient - rank after rank of ragged and dirt-encrusted cadavers forced back to life by their masters' necromantic power."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String70" text="The Empire of Man, the sprawling nation of humans dominating the Old World, faces a daily struggle for survival. Guided by their Emperor, Karl Franz, its armies stand as a testament to unwavering discipline and unmatched martial skills. In a world teeming with brutal savages and bloodthirsty monsters, the Empire endures thanks to the renowned discipline of its armies, honed through rigorous training and fortified by their unyielding faith in Sigmar. A beacon of human resilience, the Empire's soldiers exemplify the indomitable spirit of man that prevails amidst its endless list of foes."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String71" text="The Kingdom of Bretonnia is a land renowned for powerful Knights and their strong sense of Chivalry. Guided by the Fey Enchantress and the Damsels of the Lady, the peasants toil while their noble lords protect them from the many dangers threating their survival. In times of war the whole kingdom can join together, led in a crusade against their enemies by King Louen Leoncoeur, against which no foe has known victory."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String72" text="Mousillon, the accursed state nestled within the heart of Bretonnia, casts a dark and ominous shadow over the land. Once a proud dukedom, it now stands as a grim testament to the corruption that lingers in the shadows. Ruled by the Serpent of Mousillon, the realm of swamps and thickets contrasts against the vibrant setting of noble Bretonnia. Yet, even more tragic and unsettling are its mutated peasantry, ruled not by noble knights but the twisted undead, whose black knights evoke a chilling blend of traditional Bretonnian martial prowess and unholy power."/>

  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String407" text="The Cult of Sigmar, also sometimes called the Church of Sigmar, the Holy Temple of Sigmar, the Clergy of Sigmar or simply the Sigmarite Cult, is the state church of the Empire that administrates the worship of that realm's patron god, Sigmar Heldenhammer. The Cult of Sigmar was founded by the wild-eyed friar Johann Helstrum in the year 73 IC, when he appeared before the masses to relate a vision that he experienced of Sigmar kneeling before Ulric, the god of war and winter, who placed the crown of godhood upon his brow as Sigmar took his place amongst the deities of the Old World Pantheon. As of today, the Cult of Sigmar has become an essential part of Imperial society. Nearly every city, town or village within the Empire has dedicated a portion of their wealth and land to the creation and maintenance of a Sigmarite temple, from which a priest of the Cult of Sigmar will attend to the spiritual well-being of its citizenry, whether it be through holy words of prayer or through heroic actions and trials by combat."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String408" text="The Cult of Taal and Rhya is among the most ancient and pervasive in the Old World, tracing a direct line to the primal gods from the deepest of history. The cult grew organically, as early Humans tried to explain natural phenomenon, such as thunder, the turning of the seasons, and the rise and ebb of the seas. Over time, the Gods Taal and Rhya came into being, beginning as a single entity, known as Ishnernos. This split occurred many thousands of years ago, and the Cult of Ishnernos faded into distant memory. Taal rules nature and is considered King of the Gods. He claims the wild places as his domain and is primarily worshipped by hardy woodsmen, trackers, and rangers. Rhya's worshippers are found in the cultivated fields and orchards of the Empire, and are found among farmers, fishermen, and young lovers everywhere. The Cult of Taal and Rhya is the sanctioned cult of Talabecland, and is wildly popular in the eastern and northern parts of the Empire. Of the two, Taal receives most recognition, and Rhya's role is much diminished. The grand city of Talabheim is particularly fervent in its worship of both Taal and Rhya. However, in other cities, although Rhya's name is commonly known, he worship is rare, leading many urbanites to conclude that her cult is on the decline."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String409" text="The Cult of the Lady of the Lake, or simply the Cult of the Lady, is a state-official religious cult that serves to follow and uphold the values set upon them by the Lady of the Lake, and to serve the interest of her and the Kingdom of Bretonnia. Since ancient times, the Bretonnians have worshipped the Lady of the Lake as their goddess and their primary deity, a figure of myth and legend who guides their Kings and protects their lands from harm. Worship of the Lady can be traced to the earliest days of the Kingdom. It is said that she arose from a Sacred Lake before Gilles le Breton and his Knightly Companions on the dawn of the Great Victory of Bordeleaux. Wreathed in a fey light, the Lady rose from the water bearing a Grail which overflowed with light that spilled into the waters of the lake, blessing the assembled knights until dawn's light broke over the mountains."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String411" text="Vampires of all kinds loathe the gods. They don't deny their existence, but they don't serve them, seeking to be their equal instead. The closest idea of a religion to vampires would be their shared recognition of Nagash as the creator of undeath. Ultimately, all vampires descend from him. Nagash, known by many names such as the 'Great Necromancer', the 'Great Betrayer', the 'Usurper', the 'Undying King', the 'Supreme Lord of Undeath' or simply 'He Who Shall Not Be Named' is the ultimate personification of death and the Undead, an ancient, evil being who sought to conquer this cruel, chaotic mortal world and bring about an age of Undeath that will rule for all eternity. Nagash is darkness and unreasoning hatred given form, the father and creator of the foul art of necromancy and lord of all Vampires. His every action and deed is self-serving, his achievement horrific and loathsome, and his every whim bent solely to ensure that no one shall ever deny nor challenge his right to rule ever again."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String412" text="The term Chaos Undivided refers to a faction among the forces of Chaos that serves the pantheon of the major Chaos Gods as a whole rather than owing complete fealty to one over the others. It is often represented by the Everchosen of Chaos, the mortal Chaos Lord who is the greatest champion of all the major Chaos Gods. Followers of Chaos Undivided venerate the force of Chaos itself, sometimes as an entity that some insane scholars of the Old World name the 'Great Beast' in which the major Chaos Gods are seen as a single deity whose four major constituent parts are to be worshipped equally as different emanations of the same universal force. At times, this entity sets aside its mad internal struggle, which is otherwise known as the Great Game, to make it possible for the fragmented armies of the major Chaos Gods to gather together under one banner, such as during the various Chaos incursions into the Known World like the Great War Against Chaos and the End Times. These moments cause the Old World to tremble and quake in fear and loathing."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String413" text="Slaanesh, also known as the 'Dark Prince', the 'Prince of Pleasure', the 'Lord of Excess', the 'God of Obsession', 'the Serpent', the 'Master of Excess in All Things', the 'Perfect Prince' and even the 'Prince of Chaos' is the major Chaos God of pleasure, passion, obsession, excess, hedonism, decadence and pain. Born of mortal inspiration and desire, Slaanesh is the great muse, the fulfiller of dreams. He is passion given form. He is pleasure incarnate, from the intellectual satisfaction of a problem solved to the fulfilment of baser desires. His is the domain of frustration and agony, the struggle to achieve that which mortals covet. He is titillation. He is suffering. He is the sum of all mortal experience."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String414" text="Nurgle, also known as the 'Plague Lord', 'Grandfather Nurgle', the 'Lord of Pestilence', the 'Fly Lord', the 'Urfather' and 'the Crow' among many other names is the major Chaos God of disease, decay, despair, destruction, death and rebirth. Nurgle is the Chaos God most directly involved with the plight of mortals, particularly Men, who suffer so acutely from a fear of death. He is the eldest of the four Chaos Gods and indeed is undoubtedly the oldest Chaos God of all, for the process of death and decay is as ancient as life itself. Nurgle is the embodiment of the constant cycle of death and rebirth which animates all life in the universe, and was brought into being by mortals' fears of death and the despair they feel about their inevitable mortality from age and disease."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String415" text="Khorne, also known as the 'Blood God', the 'Lord of Murder', the 'Lord of Skulls', 'Hunter of Souls' and 'the Hound' in Norsca, is the major Chaos God of war, hatred, wrath, rage, murder, blood, strength, courage and martial honour. Khorne is the second eldest of the major Ruinous Powers and his waxing strength in this time of constant conflict often renders him the mightiest of the Chaos Gods in his effect on the mortal world and in the Great Game between the gods. His domain encompasses the most basic and brutal of sentient emotions - hate, anger, rage, the desire for destruction and the joy of killing one's enemies. Every act of killing or murder in the mortal world feeds and empowers Khorne, the more senseless, vicious and bloodthirsty, the better."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String416" text="Tzeentch, also known as the 'Changer of Ways', the 'Lord of Change', the 'Architect of Fate', the 'Wind-lord', the 'Raven God', and the 'Great Conspirator' is the major Chaos God of change, evolution, ambition, intrigue, destiny, lies, trickery, sorcery, knowledge, and mutation. Though weary scholars of daemonology know this god by the name of Tzeentch, in truth, he exceeds all the other Ruinous Powers in his number of facets, names and aspects. For he is change, said to embody every mortal creature's recognition of, and desire, to change, to grow, to move, to seek more -- more knowledge, more wealth, more power. His face and form shifts and turns from eternity unto eternity."/>

Many of the cloth remain in their temples and cathedrals but you know the truth; the cursed and the damned must be sought out and vanquished."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String460" text="Sired by Abhorash, the Blood Knight is a dark mockery of everything noble or virtuous that can be said about their mortal counterparts. Where before the Blood Kiss there was honour is now cruelty; faith turns to irreverence and duty falls to wanton ambition. This is true of all vampires but seems particularly tragic for the fallen knights of the Old World."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String461" text="Known and feared by many names, Vampires are the night's dark master. Nighly anyone be they Man or Beast, Holy or Daemonic can face one and survive. All Vampires strive to be the only masters of their unlife, free from any obligations to religions or masters. This egomaniacal drive is what fuels them to greater and greater ambitions, so that one day they may be lord of all they observe."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String462" text="To be a Man in the 25th century is to be one of thousands. The Old World finds itself on the precipice of destruction and turmoil, of chaos and death. No one in this age can be weak; some use the times to their advantage and turn warfare into wealth, combat into glory and tragedy into destiny. Mercenary they may call you, whatever the name no one will control your fate."/>
  <string id="Reiko_ROT_String463" text="To be a knight of Bretonnia is to strive for the blessing of the Lady and her holy grail. Any man deemed worthy to sup from her chalice becomes a holy warrior honored and respected across all of Bretonnia and yet farther. The road to that goal is difficult, so much so that most knights fail to accomplish despite all sharing the same dream."/>

Blocked damage counts as 10% of the damage taken."/>
