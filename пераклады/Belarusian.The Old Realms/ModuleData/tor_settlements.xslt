The site upon which the modern city now lies has been occupied since before the time of Sigmar when the Averlanders were still called Brigrundians. The dockyards here are particularly bustling due to the Aver serving as the primary trade route for the Halfling goods from the Moot into the wider empire. The bluff that the city sits upon protects the inhabitants from occasional flooding and has always served as an ideal crossing point across the Aver River; making the Griffin bridge one of the only places for many miles which provides access across the river for merchants and travellers heading north into Stirland or south into Averland. The skyline of the city is dominated by the Averburg Palace, a formidable fortress originally built around the founding of the Empire; views of the surrounding lands from the palace go for several miles all around the city. The city is famous for its cattle stockyards, the final destination of thousands of Averland cattle, the Plenzerplatz and of course its lord; Marious Lietdorf, the mad count of Averland.</xsl:attribute>

The town is overseen by the High and Chivalric Order of Deserved Rest, better known as the Raven Knights, whose Grandmaster personally sees to the protection of the people here. Stewardship over Siegfriedhof was granted to the Morrian templars by the Elector Count of Stirland, in gratitude for the Order's contribution in the Battle of Hel Fenn, 400 years prior. The town is also the site of the Abbey of Blessed Aethelbert the Vigilant. Due to the significant cult presence of the Morrians, Siegfriedhof is often used as a staging area for agents to keep watch over Sylvania. The people of Siegfriedhof are quite suspicious of strangers, and preemptive lynchings of unknown travellers have been known to occur.</xsl:attribute>

Once Pfeildorf was as grand a city as Wissenburg and Solland as rich a province as Averland or Stirland. After an Orc invasion in the early 18th century killed off most of the nobility and sent the majority of its population into flight, Pfeildorf and the former province was informally split between Wissenland and Averland. Emperor Magnus the Pious in the 24th century attempted to restore Solland, defining its borders with Averland and Wissenland and reconstituting it as the Grand Barony of Solland. However, Solland still remains heavily intertwined with Wissenland and despite several legal agreements is in reality a part of Wissenland. Today Pfeildorf is the centre for the Sudenland wool trade, founded along the waters where the upper Reik and the River Soll meet enables the city to be a natural place for local wool and dwarf trade from the southern grey mountains to be loaded onto ships destined for Nuln and farther.</xsl:attribute>

The Guild does most of their business out of the dwarf constructed and fortified Guildhaus, which is said to be where the guild stores most of its silver ingots for later use by its members.

The city itself is built within a huge shallow crater called the Taalbaston, which is many miles across, whose outer edge formed a large rocky rim and a natural wall. This wall has been built up and fortified with many tall gun towers and effectively marks the boundary of the city itself. The land inside is extensive and includes fertile farmlands, a lake filled with fresh water as well as the grand city itself, ensuring that should a mighty enemy be able to breach through Talabecland's armies, so long as the enemy is held back by the great crater walls, the city and its proud people can withstand the onslaught of siege almost indefinitely. The River Talabec flows around the outside of the crater, and where it flows past the north-eastern edge of the wall, there is a fortified Imperial town known as Taalagrad and a deep harbour from which lies the river fleets. The largest of Talabheim’s temples is dedicated to Taal and to a lesser extent Rhya. Even though the primary place of Taal’s worship continues to be the Sacred Forest, worshippers who live within the confines of the city value an opportunity to seek spiritual enlightenment without making a trip to the other end of the crater.</xsl:attribute>

The barrels are said to be so sturdy as to be able to protect their contents even from direct cannon fire. Every year Holthusen hosts the Weinfest, a great gathering for wine tasting that requires an invite to enter. Of course the lack of invite does not stop the horde of wastrels and rogues who wish to drink the free wine provided by the festival. Weinfest also marks the only time of year during which the Golden Cask is brought out, which is said to contain the best wine in the Empire if not the entire Old World. Due to the town's forested location, it is frequently attacked by beastmen. The palisades and guards are normally strong enough to see the monsters off, but the townspeople fear the day this defence falls short. As such, some of the townspeople have been leaving casks of cheap wine at the edge of the woods in an attempt to appease the beastmen with tribute.

Their plan was to create two ports that would siphon off traffic from Marienburg, thus cutting out the middlemen there and creating more profits for themselves. To this end, Pugsblatter was bought in 2460 and renamed Neues Emskrank. The local residents were forced out and resettled in the area of Wilhelmskoog, and colonists were brought in to reinvigorate the place. The cartel built houses and shops to give the city a fresh look, they invested in warehouses to handle the traffic surely coming their way, and they built new trading caravels that would be the vanguard of their fleet.

        <xsl:attribute name="text">{=town_WA1.text}Marienburg is one of the greatest human cities in the Old World, and possibly the wealthiest, rivalled only by Altdorf, Erengrad, Miragliano, and the richest cities of Araby. Situated at the point where the River Reik enters the Sea of Claws, Marienburg is the only route for maritime trade to efficiently leave or enter the Empire. The city itself sits on a series of islands connected together by bridges and boat travel. To the north and south, the Vloedmuur wall sits just off the coast to defend the city from flooding and attacks by land. The wall is an ancient one, originally built by elves. The modern wall has been built and rebuilt several times atop the old elven foundations and the Directorate - Marienburg’s executive council - has spent a great fortune modernising its gates and redoubts. The defence of the city from attacks along the Reik, or from the Manaanspoort Sea, falls on Marienburg’s substantial navy. Just a century ago, the Wasteland was one of the jewels of Sigmar's empire, but after generations of benign neglect by a series of successive emperors, the merchants and burghers of Marienburg declared their independence. Emperor Wilhelm III launched several unsuccessful expeditions against the separatist province, all of which failed, culminating in independence being granted by treaty in 2429. Today, Marienburg is ruled by its legislature, the Stadsraad, and its executive council, the Directorate. Under this ‘republican’ rule, trade has continued to flow through Marienburg and many consider the city to be in a golden age. It is protected by its reputation of being nearly ungovernable and its varied mercenary forces, as well as by the River Reik and the marshes and swamps around. Nevertheless, the new Emperor, Karl Franz, may want to accomplish what his great-great-grandfather was unable to do. At the same time, Bretonnian dukes have made attempts in the past to incorporate Marienburg into their domains; who knows if King Louen will make an attempt of his own to expand the Marches of Couronne?</xsl:attribute>
