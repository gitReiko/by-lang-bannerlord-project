    <string id="tutorial_guards3" text="A guard is a party that is created out of your currently garrisoned troops. Each Improved Garrison may have one guard party. Guard parties have a advanced custom AI build on top of the base games AI. The guards AI thinks about stuff like &quot;I should defend XY village&quot;, &quot;I shouldn't attack XY party it is to fast or to strong&quot;, &quot;I should go back to a settlement and heal my units&quot;, and more!" />
    <string id="tutorial_guards4" text="Each guard can also be given orders. The most common usage is the defense of your region. If you tell the guard to patrol it will walk around the region clear looters and bandits and defend against sieges and raids. You may also tell the guards to escort parties. The guards will then follow the party and defend it. This can be useful if you need help with your next attack or you want one of your caravans to be protected." />
