			 text="{=rum_sultanate_text}The Sultanate of Rum was a culturally Turco-Persian Sunni Muslim state, established over conquered Roman territories and peoples of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks following their entry into Anatolia after the Battle of Manzikert (1071). The name RÃ»m was a synonym for the medieval Eastern Roman Empire and its peoples, as it remains in modern Turkish. The Sultanate of Rum seceded from the Great Seljuk Empire under Suleiman ibn Qutalmish in 1077, just six years after the roman provinces of central Anatolia were conquered at the Battle of Manzikert (1071). It had its capital first at Nicaea and then at Iconium.">
