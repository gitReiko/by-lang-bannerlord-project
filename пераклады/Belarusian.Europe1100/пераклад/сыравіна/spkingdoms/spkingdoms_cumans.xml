			 text="{=cuman_khanate_text}The Cumans were a Turkic nomadic people from Central Asia, comprising the western branch of the Cuman–Kipchak confederation who spoke the Cuman language. After the Mongol invasion, many sought asylum in the Kingdom of Hungary, as many Cumans had settled in Hungary, the Second Bulgarian Empire playing an important role in the development of the state. Cumans played also an important role in the Roman Empire, the Latin Empire, and the Nicaea Empire's Anatolia. Related to the Pecheneg, they inhabited a shifting area north of the Black Sea and along the Volga River known as Cumania, from which the Cuman–Kipchaks meddled in the politics of the Caucasus and the Khwarazmian Empire. The Cumans were fierce and formidable nomadic warriors of the Eurasian Steppe who exerted an enduring influence on the medieval Balkans. They were numerous, culturally sophisticated, and militarily powerful.">
