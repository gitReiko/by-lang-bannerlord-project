			 text="{=rus_kingdom_text}The Rus were a people in early medieval eastern Europe. The scholarly consensus holds that they were originally Norsemen, mainly originating from present day Sweden, who settled and ruled along the river routes between the Baltic and the Black Seas from around the 8th to 11th centuries AD. In the 9th century, they formed the state of Kievan Rus, where the ruling Norsemen along with local Finnic tribes gradually assimilated into the East Slavic population, with Old East Slavic becoming the common spoken language.">
