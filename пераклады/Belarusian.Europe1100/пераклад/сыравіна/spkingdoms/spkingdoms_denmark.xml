			 text="{=denmark_kingdom_text}Around the year 1100, Denmark was a kingdom undergoing significant political and territorial developments. The reign of King Eric I of Denmark, also known as Eric Ejegod, marked a period of expansion and consolidation of royal power. Eric Ejegod sought to extend Danish influence through various military campaigns, including successful expeditions in present-day Norway and the Baltic region. During this time, Denmark was also impacted by the rise of the Catholic Church, which led to the establishment of several bishoprics and increased ecclesiastical authority. However, the kingdom faced internal challenges, including power struggles among noble families and conflicts over succession. The events of the 12th century set the stage for further transformations in Danish history, shaping the country's political landscape for centuries to come.">
