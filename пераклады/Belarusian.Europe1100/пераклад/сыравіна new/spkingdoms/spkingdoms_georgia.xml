		   text="{=georgia_kingdom_text}The Kingdom of Georgia, also known as the Georgian Empire, was a medieval Eurasian monarchy that was founded in c.1008 AD. It reached its Golden Age of political and economic strength during the reign of King David IV and Queen Tamar the Great from the 11th to 13th centuries. Georgia became one of the pre-eminent nations of the Christian East and its pan-Caucasian empire and maintained network of tributaries stretching from Eastern Europe to Anatolia and the northern frontiers of Iran. It was the principal historical precursor of present-day Georgia.">
