  <string id="town_T5desc" text="Kyoten sits by the reed-marshes on the edge of Lake Tanaesis. In the years when the east was an imperial protectorate, boats laden with hides, wool and salt shuttled across the lake's placid waters, returning with imperial silks and silver. With the coming of the Khuzaits and the subsequent wars the water-trade stopped, but Chaikand remains a major trade entrepot and military base, the fief of the ruling Urkhunait clan. From the pavilions of his palace, the khan can look out across the lake and see the hazy outline of hills that he may one day graze his horses upon."/>
