  <string id="EMkaeD9M" text="Hmm. Many men would begin their story by reciting their ancestry. I will not do this. A man should be judged on his own deeds, and a long list of ancestors does him no credit. Also, my family does not acknowledge me, so why should I acknowledge them?"/>
  <string id="RaSZtTqh" text="I was the son of a slave. My master, a judge, raised me in his house, but it was clear that he would never spend much time to ensure my success in the world. Still, I was tutored with his other sons, and chose to study medicine as a young man. I thought I could perhaps be a physician."/>
  <string id="9AIyvTmF" text="Well... I was soon disabused of this idea. A doctor starting out in the world must either have a great deal of money, or family that ensures him a long list of clients. I had neither. Instead of working in the city, I took service aboard a ship."/>
  <string id="ZuHolx2r" text="Professionally, it was perhaps the best thing I could have done. Fevers, injuries, festering sores - the seaman has in greater number and variety than any manner of land-dweller, I imagine. But I have little patience for life aboard, the monotony, the tyranny of captains, the lack of any space to oneself, the groaning of timbers, the constant smell of rotting bilge..."/>
  <string id="A9r6SnWx" text="Yes, it must be trying."/>
  <string id="B7cMisFf" text="Weren't handed life on a silver platter, were you? Such a tragedy."/>
  <string id="HaQlEZPq" text="At any rate, I have a bit of money to my name, and the leisure to wait a few weeks before choosing my next employer."/>
  <string id="vgcTdEvc" text="I was the son of a slave, but my father bought me my freedom and an apprenticeship with a healer. I could make a lot of money as a doctor if I came from a well-known family that would attract patients. But I don't, so I offer my skills to war-leaders, who cannot afford to be so picky."/>
  <string id="d9qUbj3I" text="I shall tell you... Ahem..."/>
  <string id="xNPAZdtX" text="My father is Aytham, son of Thamuq, who was son of Munbilas - the elder son, mind you, not the younger - and he was son of Numayn - Numayn of the Mountain, that is, not the less illustrious ones of that name - and he was son of Zais."/>
  <string id="ikWAfIHX" text="Now some people will tell you that Zais was born of out wedlock, but those are lies. He was the legitimate son of Ghutan, and Rasad 'Ban Ghutan' doesn't deserve that name, he should be called the 'Bastard,' not Zais. Anyway, as for Ghutan's father... Well, not everyone knows this, but..."/>
  <string id="Wz71n66t" text="I'm sorry. Are you not paying attention?"/>
  <string id="N9rVRfaW" text="Oh.. Of course I am! This is fascinating. But tell me about your own deeds."/>
  <string id="SYBe3aIC" text="Do you have a trade? Any skills? Or just a string of ancestors?"/>
  <string id="KGa4gmDW" text="Ah, yes - well, it would be beneath someone with a lineage like mine to pledge allegiance to the current parvenus who call themselves the Meishu of the Tetsojin. So, I fight for those who pay me my value in denars, good noble denars."/>
  <string id="vKSGJNxT" text="I am a warrior. I would recite to you my lineage, but that would take an hour. I would tell you my deeds, but that would take two. So, instead - if you pay me - I shall come with you and fight your enemies, and that will be the best demonstration of my mettle."/>
  <string id="AVqbfwrh" text="I will tell you. Perhaps you will think I am petty-minded, but a man's reputation is a valuable thing..."/>
  <string id="TNOM6nuo" text="I am from one of the lesser known clans of the Tetsojin. We take the name of an undistinguished younger son of the Qildi line from five generations back. We have never held fiefs or won much wealth, but when the Qild called out their kinfolk, or the tribes were summoned by the Sultan, we took our place in the battle line."/>
  <string id="H8wpFACA" text="The great names in our great clans - some of them are brave, and generous with the loot, but don't they like to take their names bandied out after every battle? Poets know there's silver in it if they sing the praises of the Banu Qild, the Banu Sarran - but those of us who are Banu Nobody, well, we deserve a bit of time in the sun too, don't you think?"/>
  <string id="2BKMNXE7" text="I fought three battles under the banner of the Sultan, and two more under the banners of the Qild. No more."/>
  <string id="AMMXrcC9" text="Indeed. Glory is as much a spoil of war as any, and should be shared."/>
  <string id="iztRBaaF" text="Frankly, I have little time for glory-hounds of any sort. Men who do their job is what I want."/>
  <string id="lQ4PPsnT" text="At any rate, I will find a master who allows me to win fame for myself. Or barring that, land and silver, so that I can buy a poet or two."/>
  <string id="q71Cbib7" text="I am a warrior, but I am not from one of the greater clans. After a battle, I may get a bloodstained weapon pried from the enemy's hand or a pat on the head from my emir, but no song of my deeds. No robe of honor. I intend to fight for someone who see in people more than their name."/>
  <string id="2PZsQPty" text="I will tell you my story. I haven't... I haven't spoken of this before, to anyone. Perhaps it's the wine here. But know that if you speak of this to anyone else, I'll cut your tongue out."/>
  <string id="Agbh1AmR" text="I have a gift... From the Heavens, perhaps, or perhaps from somewhere else. I have never met anyone I could not kill in a fair fight. But I do not like wars. Armies are full of crude men, boasters, drunks, rapists. I have another speciality."/>
  <string id="33Dzgon7" text="Say you had a man you wanted killed. Who you would pay to kill. I could find him, bump into him, mutter an insult. He would pull out his blade. And that would be the last mistake he would ever make. But as I said, it would be a fair fight. I do not kill from behind. It is dishonorable."/>
  <string id="PHVJ9fOm" text="But there was a lord, a customer of mine, who had no honor. And he refused to pay me. And having no honor, he laughed at my insults. He did not pull his blade. He had his men drive me away. I can kill one man but not three at once. So here I am."/>
  <string id="mijieuku" text="You know, I'm sure you could put your gift to better use."/>
  <string id="0dQLkzEw" text="What you call 'honor'... I'm not sure that's the best word for it."/>
  <string id="OHFZ9EAk" text="Mmm.... Well, for now, I do not know what to do with myself. Perhaps I could consider joining a warband, if the commander was well-bred and kept his word."/>
  <string id="KNQCoxIJ" text="I am a sword for hire. Some think us scum but I have my own code of honor. If I kill a man, it must be in a fair fight. My last employer asked me to do something dishonorable, so now I am looking for a new employer."/>
  <string id="XVZGCB0a" text="Yeah, sure."/>
  <string id="LjkQ4fYp" text="I come from a town where every alley has its 'protector.' These are men with some strength but also a lot of respect, who stand up for the rights of the people there. My father was our alley's protector, and so it fell on me to take his job after he grew too old to do it himself."/>
  <string id="Z8TfQDSV" text="A few years after he retired, we had a new guard captain. We protectors, we serve the state, but we're not its tool. This new captain didn't understand. He'd come to me and say, 'One of my lads took this man's daughter - see that he doesn't make a fuss,' or, 'Let's have little private meetings, so you can tell us what your people are up to.' "/>
  <string id="PWpTT0NM" text="I told the captain that I couldn't do these things. The alley people - they had to trust me. The captain didn't take 'no' for an answer. He pressured me. He threatened my father. What could I do? I couldn't betray my people but I couldn't betray my father either. I took my family and left."/>
  <string id="yXhf3AJk" text="A hard choice."/>
  <string id="nlRg040C" text="Better to have properly constituted authority than that of some back-alley tough."/>
  <string id="Vwhnrf66" text="So here I am. I have mouths to feed, and the thing I know best is to fight."/>
  <string id="zTNhw5T6" text="I'm from a town near here. I won't say which one... Our family were protectors of our alley, and by that I mean that I thumped the head of anyone who tried to take away our rights. But the guard captain, he kept coming around demanding money and favors, and I couldn't thump his head. So now I'm looking for new work."/>
  <string id="41Et3Siz" text="You want a story? Then go toss a copper to a fellow who knows the song of Kais and Layali, because you won't get one from me."/>
  <string id="DRv6hB6p" text="Here's what you need to know about me - I can take a man down with a single blow, or maybe two if he's got armor, and I have expensive tastes in wine and women. So I don't work for free."/>
  <string id="37d1A0AM" text="I kill for a living. Some men, in my line of work, will spin a tale of how they were forced into it, orphans of war or some-such. Piss on that."/>
  <string id="osaIOFNx" text="I like to fight, I'm good at it, and in my opinion, the Heavens smile on a man who loves his job."/>
  <string id="iZPiYDbj" text="Can't fault you for enthusiasm, I suppose."/>
  <string id="kzvTFUbj" text="That's a rather unique theology."/>
  <string id="r8vQ3KpJ" text="You want me to kill for you? Then make me an offer. If not, piss off."/>
  <string id="wGyCPQwG" text="I kill for a living. If you want me to kill for you, pay me what I'm worth. If you don't, then don't waste my time."/>
  <string id="5QpIypgB" text="Since you ask who I am, stranger, I will tell you."/>
  <string id="Ke9L8QbX" text="The searing gravel plain knows me, as do the rippling sands and the shadowed canyon. The hidden spring whispers to me, 'Come hither and drink,' and the high outcrop unveils to me the horizons."/>
  <string id="fELWdbuL" text="The viper does not trouble me, nor does the scorpion. I have faced the scouring sandstorm, the rushing flood, the killing heat of noontime, and they have all said to me, 'Pass safely, brother.'"/>
  <string id="rP2EVSvT" text="I am {MET_WANDERER.FIRSTNAME}, prince of the wastelands, lord of solitude, master of emptiness. If you wish to know my other names, you may ask my kinsmen, the leopard, the hyena and the gazelle.."/>
  <string id="xagl8d4w" text="{MET_WANDERER.FIRSTNAME} is fine. No need to bother the hyenas. So, what can you do?"/>
  <string id="5d6Xifm1" text="Master of empty talk, rather."/>
  <string id="C5pqZtNs" text="I roam the desert. I learn its secret ways, its gifts, as a lover learns the secrets and gifts of his beloved. But though the desert is bountiful, horses and steel must be bought with silver. So, I must sell my services from time to time."/>
  <string id="V6boHnpo" text="I am of the desert. I know its ways. The wind guides me. The scorpion comes into my camp at night and tells me its secrets. The howls of the jackal bring me news of the hunt."/>
  <string id="AH4ell4y" text="Hmf. Very well. I'll tell you - and you can decide for yourself whether my family should be ashamed of me."/>
  <string id="KbP87Fzv" text="I was part of a clan that lived beyond the mountains to the south. We came under pressure from our neighbors, who wanted to take our lush grazing grounds in the foothills. We were an ancient clan, that valued its name, but in this generation we have been short of men, so I fought alongside my brothers - indeed, I slew our enemies' champion in single combat. That stopped the pressure on our lands, but not the violence. "/>
  <string id="lwvQCrG2" text="We kept our grazing grounds. But my brothers and cousins found that, when they mingled with other clans during the holy months of truce, that they were mocked. 'You let your women do your fighting!'"/>
  <string id="X8Zkp0Ut" text="The insults were many, and they had no choice but to respond. One cousin was slain in a duel, one cousin killed his opponent, so we had two new bloodfeuds on our hands. I chose to leave home before it got any worse."/>
  <string id="VJDZp4rM" text="An impossible situation..."/>
  <string id="zZfHxtS5" text="Honor must come first!"/>
  <string id="2ZiWirPM" text="I find that I like to fight, and the pay is good. But I will do my fighting far from home, so that no shame attaches itself to my family's name."/>
  <string id="8TabS6RW" text="I was a daughter of a wealthy clan. But our rivals drove us from our grazing grounds. We had to sell our herds. We were mocked in towns when we went to trade in the marketplace. Luckily my father was one of those wise enough to teach his daughters to fight. With the Heavens' help I will become wealthy and famous, and restore our family name."/>
  <string id="1ssGvu9j" text="I can tell you my story. If you spend time among merchants, I suppose you will hear it anyway, told as a cautionary tale, complete with a great deal of moralizing and tut-tutting."/>
  <string id="Gepa1szA" text="My father was a merchant. When he died, he left his children a small inheritance. Most went to my brothers. They headed east, to the lands of the Padishah, leaving me in charge of our interests in Calradia. For me to step into my father's shoes, and be treated as an equal by other merchants, I knew I had to make a lot of money in a short time or they would elbow me out of the market."/>
  <string id="jnbQL2ta" text="I had an opportunity to buy pepper from another trader who was selling at a discount, and needed cash. I of course inspected the pepper and its storage. I interviewed the watchmen at the warehouse. You can trust us madame,' they said. 'Rest assured your pepper is in good hands.'"/>
  <string id="YOzdVTeS" text="But one of them kept a brazier lit at night, for the warmth, and a camel kicked it into a bed of straw when he was off relieving himself. When he returned, the warehouse was in flames. And so became penniless."/>
  <string id="EB6RcaTF" text="Merchants take risks. I am sorry it turned out so badly for you."/>
  <string id="Nz0iyKaM" text="All one's pepper in one warehouse. A cautionary tale indeed."/>
  <string id="bk3Ir2uC" text="Well... Even now I feel I made a wise choice to buy the pepper -- wise, but unlucky. Such is fortune! Had I not seized this opportunity, other merchants would have mocked me, a woman who lacked the daring to succeed in a man's trade. Instead they mock a rash woman who lacked a man's judgment. And here I am, looking for work."/>
  <string id="OohIyeJo" text="My parents were merchants, and I inherited a share of their workshops and camels. But banditry and the fortunes of trade ruined me, which is also common, and now I must make my money some other way."/>
  <string id="CE8we5VF" text="Oh, I'll tell you my story. I don't mind who knows."/>
  <string id="OcCLz4je" text="When I was a child, my mother sent me out on the streets to beg and pick pockets. And the big man of our quarter took a cut of that. I got a little older and my mother taught me how to rob drunken travellers, and the big man took a cut of that."/>
  <string id="NDR2Xcoq" text="But you see, for a big man, it's not all sitting in the shade and counting your money. A big man must beat and he must kill, or people will not fear you. And one day, as I watched, he beat my mother to death over the share of his cut."/>
  <string id="G7ZQb9tQ" text="Now some would say I should have avenged my mother. But there was a wrinkle, you see - we didn't talk about it much, but he was my father, as he was the father of so many other children of our alley. So I fled our town, and now work here, using the skills my dear parents taught me."/>
  <string id="qxBbhtLH" text="Perhaps you can rise above the sorry circumstances of your birth."/>
  <string id="pKMVhx2v" text="They never cease to shock me, the sordid tales you hear from the dregs of the alleys."/>
  <string id="x6acpIw7" text="So... Anyway, if you've got an enterprise or two that might not be entirely legal, and need a sharp eye on the villains you've got running it, you may find that my skills are of use to you."/>
  <string id="bRE8iZqE" text="I had no father, see. None that I knew. There are scores of us in every town, begging and stealing and working for the gangs. But I was always the type of girl who wanted something more, and I got ahold of this sword, you see, and now I intend to turn other people's blood into silver."/>
  <string id="rgSWtZ0w" text="I'll tell you my story. I suppose it is a fine lesson in how destiny makes mock of our intentions."/>
  <string id="ZSaGzgmN" text="My father was a judge, and I had intended to study the legal rulings of the past, so I could follow in his footsteps. But when I went to study, my master told me that only two kinds of scholars were needed these days: those who knew how to build and knock down walls, and those who knew how to stem the epidemics that spread from unburied bodies."/>
  <string id="cyjb9lmm" text="I had no talent for medicine, it turned out, so I chose to be an engineer. I had one final flight of folly - a local academy was crumbling, so I submitted a sketch for a new one to the emir. He laughed and told me to come back with a schematic of siege engines. "/>
  <string id="PKzUUVKC" text="So go on - ask me how thick a mangonel's struts must be to withstand the torsion to throw a five-istar ball. Ask me how heavy a ram's head must be, compared to its total weight, so that it does not rebound from the gate and strike the men who wield it. I never imagined I would know such things, when I dreamed of making men's lives better through the dispensing of justice."/>
  <string id="gMiceyRl" text="Well, some day there may be peace, and money to build again."/>
  <string id="KrXlrnsg" text="The quarries are hiring. You could always haul rocks for a living, if you're so averse to launching them."/>
  <string id="XKsjweaA" text="Unfortunately, I've found that siegework pays irregularly. My contracts are usually honored if the city falls and is looted. But if dysentery breaks out in the siege camp and the army must march away, well, you may find that you submit your receipts in vain."/>
  <string id="wQRSM1lz" text="My father was a judge, and as such, I was educated to be a judge. That is usually the case with us. But I was always better at mathematics than letters. So I took mercenary work, making catapults. My father cast me out of his home in disgust. He once told me that the greatest privilege on earth is to dispense justice, but he will never know the joy of firing a mine and seeing the walls of a tyrannical baron or cruel archon crumble, so what does he know?"/>
